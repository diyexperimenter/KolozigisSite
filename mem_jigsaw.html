<H3>MemJigsaw Program</H3>
<P>Memorize vocabulary words (or any other definitions) while you do a jigsaw puzzle.
   Just drag and drop the pieces with your mouse and when you get a correct match, they click and stay
   together. Load new word sets anytime during the game.</P>
<P>The sample files are some French-English pairs.  Could be things like Element-Atomic
Number/Atomic Weight pairs. You can write your own pairs very simply with any ASCII text
   editor like Windows NotePad:  just save-as one of the files that presently work as
   your new name.  Then write in your own words (or numbers) between the existing 
   quotation marks and save the file. Run MyPuzVocab31807.exe and select your new text file and 
   you should get your new word set to appear.</P>
<P>As of this writing, chatgpt is still available free. You could prompt chatgpt to create your word
	files from content you are trying to learn.</P>
