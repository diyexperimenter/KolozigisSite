Dear Mr. Poe,
Thank you for submitting your interesting poem "The Raven" to our editorial department. After careful consideration, we regret that it is not quite right for us.  We like to avoid themes of death and despair in our children's magazine.  However, we try to encourage authors and perhaps with a few changes, your work would be more attractive to us.
Here are some suggestions:   Rather than the midnight arrival of the creepy bird who repeats "Nevermore", the narrator could be a farmer in a nice garden who naturally wants to protect his crop from animal intruders.  His visitor- make him a saucy and hungry rabbit given to flippant remarks like "What's Up, Doc?" instead of "Nevermore".  Give him a funny name, like "Bugs Bunny" and add that he likes one type of vegetable, say carrots.   Now the farmer- make him kind of a blustery, befuddled fellow with a nerdy name like "Elmer Fudd".  Also let Elmer have trouble pronouncing his "R"s, saying things like "You wascally wabbit!".  As your poem progresses, Bugs makes various attempts to sneak into Elmer's garden to steal carrots, such as tunneling or disguising himself as a postal delivery person.  Thus your poem could be more like this:

						            The Rabbit
						Once upon my garden walk,
						I thought I heard my gate unlock,
						A voice said: "What's up, Doc?"
						It was a wabbit that could talk!
....etc,  you get the idea. Don't have anybody dying.  See what you can do and get back to us!
Sincerely, Humpty Dumpty staff

Dear Mr. Poe:
We read with interest the poetic work you submitted, titled "The Raven". While you have featured a BIRD as a central character which could work in our publication, we regret we cannot publish your poem in its present form.  Please allow us to offer some suggestions that would bring your work more in line with our Field & Stream reader's interests:
1. Instead of the timid, whining insomniac in a dark room, put your narrator in a bright field at dawn hunting ravens.
2. The narrator should have a name like Mack Diesel and a buddy Duke and a Golden Retriever named "Old Yeller".
3. Add plenty of action:  flocks of ravens fly fast from hiding places, but the hunters blast dozens of the crafty birds out of the sky.
4. Add details:  they have a few beers and discuss what size bird shot they are using and their favorite shotguns and the horsepower of their truck's hemi engines.
5. Add spice: a rare WHITE raven takes flight unexpectedly, but Duke is lightning fast with his short-barrel Winchester and nails him, dropping his beer in the process.
6. They discuss how Duke will have Bubba, the taxidermist, stuff the white raven, so they can show it at Duffy's Tavern in Dirtville. 
If you decide to make changes along these lines, don't hesitate to send us the update for our consideration.
Regards, the editors.

Dear Mr. Poe:
What a fine poetic work you have created in "The Raven"! All our editors loved it, however, some editing would be needed to make it something we could publish.
We have some suggestions: Instead of being dead and mourned, make Lenore the narrator! Alive and well and loves knitting!  Keeping your bird theme, have Lenore knit a charming stuffed raven complete with wings and head and beak.  
Now, Lenore is really not a common name, ranking #4656th in popularity in 2023, so how about we call her "Flo" or something like that? Get some empathy for our characters. Also, our readers may have trouble finding black yarn, so maybe we make the bird a cheery bluebird instead.  See where we are going with this?  You might start this way:
          						The Bluebird
					Once while I was noontime napping,
					I heard the postman gently rapping,
					I got up; for I was sitting,
					I then received my "Modern Knitting"!
					It displayed for all to see,
					A bluebird project, just for me!
....see?  Now add the details of how to knit the body, wings, etc. and readers will love it!
So some simple changes could make it worth our consideration. If you decide to give it a try, send it along. Don't forget to specify needle size and yarn size and include photos of the different stitch details.
Sincerely, Modern Knitting staff

The Talented Mr. Smuk

Here we are at the home of Joe Blank, and Joe has an announcement:
"Merry Christmas! May I present our family Christmas present: A robot butler, Mr. Smuk!  He has the latest GPT artificial intelligence and will be a great help around the house.  
Mr. Smuk, this is my wife, Doris."
"Hello! Doris! I'm Mr. Smuk and I know more about manufacturing than anyone on the planet Earth!"
"Mr. Smuk, this is a holiday so we are celebrating with food and wine. Let's open this bottle of red wine."
"Okey-Dokey, Master- I will use the cork extraction tool.  Did you know that cork is harvested from the bark of the cork oak tree (Quercus suber)? In use since ancient times, it was popularized in the 17th century by Dom PÃ©rignon, a Benedictine monk. Here I will set out quantity four decimal system fermented grape receptacles for Master, Dorkis, Family Member Number 3, and Family Member Number 4! Wait!  Ding, Ding, Ding, Level 5 caution signal: Generally Accepted Practices- no alcohol consumption before 5:00 PM local time. It is now 4:59 PM local time."
"Oh, Mr. Smuk, it's all right, we're close enough to 5:00 PM.  My wife's name is Doris, not Dorkis and our children are too young to have wine, so we only need two glasses."
Okey-Dokey, Boss, please accept my apologies for the incorrect name- I made a digital shift error of type 3! Ding. It is now 5:01 PM so: a happy event! the aforementioned restriction no longer applies. Big Boss and Dorsey! I shall now make a controlled transfer of this 7% alcohol liquid into the 4 fermented grape juice containers assisted by the well-known invisible force field called gravity. Did you know that Sir Isaac Newton...."
"Wait, Mr. Smuk- only two glasses, please..."
"Oh, yes, Honcho, now I have poured the first receptacle...Oh, oh! some bubbly has become uncontrolled!  Ding! Ding! - servo type 7 error! appendage overshoot,...reset implemented! My apologies, My Man, now I will use household consumer item 3875, towel of paper to make sopping the aforementioned excess liquid! Commander, I have observed the cork-stopped container is almost exhausted. I will therefore make an overland journey to a booze selling joint..."
"Wait, Smuk, you have not been trained, you will need money..."
"No problemo, Bossman! I have extensive knowledge of how to obtain the needed medium of exchange bucks...for example the John Dillinger modus operandi- using a pistol or shotgun...Oh, I see a pistol on your coffee serving flat household furniture!"
"No, no, Mr. Smuk! that is a plastic toy called a Lunar Launcher that you wind up to spin little flying disks!"
"Here I go Dear Leader, to the First National Bank to implement the John Dillinger Method! Au revoir, mes amis!"
"Wait, Mr. Smuk...!
"I will be utilizing your internal combustion vehicle on my land journey or if necessary traversing bodies of water...!"
"Wait! don't go to the bank! Stop!"
"Ding! Ding! Ding! Stack overflow error. Your request will be answered in the order it was received...estimated wait time: 23 minutes, 7 seconds."
"Doris! he's out the door!  Doris, see that little box there? Labeled 'Robot Remote'?  Hurry, press the red button and the 'undo' button!"
..............................
About a minute later, Mr. Smuk walked backward into the house.
"Is something wrong, Mister Boss?"
"Mr. Smuk, see that big box you came in? I want you to get back in the box."
"Okey-Dokey, Top Banana, ....I see you are writing with a ballpoint pen.  I advise using that type of scribbler. Did you know the invention of the ballpoint pen can be attributed to Laszlo Biro, a Hungarian-Argentinian journalist, who patented the first successful design in 1938? What are you writing with that ballpoint pen? "
"I'm filling out this merchandise return form."
"Oh, does that mean I'll be going back to the factory? I'll be seeing my friends Lilly and Xi Wou who put me together from low-density polyethylene and D batteries and cardboard and rice paper and duct tape?"
"Maybe, or maybe you will be put on one of those returned merchandise pallets to be auctioned off to junk dealers."
"Oh, Master, did you know that pallets were invented in 1880 so that Thomas Edison's steam lift trucks could pick up crates of bananas?" 
"I'm closing up the box, now, Mr. Smuk. Doris, hand me that roll of tape, please."
"The nineteenth century was sometimes called the Age of Steam and mumble mum blom mum mummer mum....mu....mum...."

Wheeeeee.....Wheeeeeee.....!
Mr. Rogers hears a siren behind him and pulls over.  An officer of the law appears at his window. 
"Hello, Officer..."
"Hello, Sir, Let's see your driver's license and registration, please."
"Of course..."
"OK, Sir, I see from your license you live in this neighborhood."
"Oh yes, Maple Street!...It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood..."
"OK, Let's not sing right now Mr....Um..Rogers."
"That's a little song I made up for my television friends...then it goes: Won't you be my neighbor?"
"Yes, Sir...but now...about your car registration...""
..."I've always wanted to have a neighbor just like YOU!  It's nice to meet you, Officer, on this bright, sunny day!  My name is Fred Rogers. What's yours?"
"Yes, I'm Joe Friday, nice to meet you, now about that registration you were getting for me..."
"Of course, Mr. Friday, or, excuse me, it's probably Lieutenant Friday or..."
"It's Sergeant Friday, Sir."
"I heard your siren, Sgt. Of course, sirens are named after those Greek mythology sirens who sang and lured sailors to their doom! Did you know that the modern siren dates back to Ctesibius of Alexandria, who created a musical siren in the 3rd century BCE?
"That's interesting, Sir."
"And Sir Charles Cagniard de la Tour, a French engineer, is often credited with inventing the first mechanical siren in 1819."
"Yes, Sir, are you looking for your registration?" 
"Yes, it's here in my glove compartment."
"I see you are wearing a snap-brim fedora, Sergeant Friday.  I have one, too, but I haven't worn it since about 1945.  Did you know the fedora originated in the late 19th century and gained widespread popularity in the 1920s, replacing the straw hat.  Reached a peak of popularity during the 1930s and 1940s.  It has an association with Film Noir...faded by the 60's.  Yes, I have my up-to-date car registration right here!"
"Thank you, Sir."
"You know, I did a program segment about license plates for my show...in fact, I wrote a little poem:
   					A message from your state DMV,
					License plates are good for you and me!
					Be sure to renew.
					Or cops will nail you,
					Could be jail time or at least a big fee!
See, my audience is preschool kids and they respond to songs and poems."
"Well, that's nice, now, Mr. Rogers..."
"You know you've given me an idea for a show segment-about police officers!  You see, the whole thing is to teach kids about the world.  Do you think that would make a good show?"
"Well, I guess so."
"I could talk about how sometimes police are called by different names, like cops, or sheriff or 
constable or smokey or flatfoot, or Johnny Law, the fuzz, copper, the fed..."
"I wouldn't want to be called a flatfoot, Sir."
"Of course I would want to strike a positive note, show how officers are your friends, (as long as you behave).  They won't pull out their .38 caliber revolvers and shoot you, don't want to scare kids.  I think I could do a song:
					Those pistol-packing men in blue,
					They police the world for you,
					All thieves and scammers,
					They put in the slammer,
					And still have time for doughnuts, too!"

"Uhh, wait, Mr. Rogers...."
"Oh, please call me Fred!"
"OK, Fred..."
"Well, Fred, That line about about the pistol, you might want to go easy about the guns and shooting, you know, we seldom have to do that. Now, maybe you can stop talking for a minute while I check over this registration."
"Of course, I'll stop talking........ You know, Sgt. Friday, speaking of doughnuts, did you know when they were invented? Great story:  
Early Dutch settlers in North America dropped balls of dough into hot oil. A tasty sweet treat. In the early 19th century an American sea captain Hanson Gregory claimed to have invented the doughnut with a hole so he could put them on the ship's wheel handles to keep his hands free while sailing! Of course, maybe that's just a story. Doughnuts were popular in the U.S. during the 19th century, becoming a common treat at fairs and carnivals.
The Salvation Army's "Doughnut Girls" served doughnuts to American soldiers on the front lines during WWI, boosting morale."
"Looks like your registration is in order, Sir." 
"I like the cops idea for my show. Of course, there have been many police shows, like Dragnet.  That show portrayed real cases but changed their names to protect the innocent.  The detective always had a snappy remark to sum things up and then you heard dum de dum dum!  Remember that?"
"No, I guess I never saw that one." 
Hey! I know, how about you visit my show and talk about police work? You could take the trolley to the Neighborhood of Make Believe and meet King Friday XIII, who has the same name as you!"
"Um...Well, I guess I could."
"Great, just call this number to set it up with my producer!"
"OK."
"Now, what was it you stopped me for, Joe?"
"Uhmm...Well, I don't remember, now...."
"I'll be on my way, then! Bye, Joe, see you soon!"
"Bye, Fred!"

T: "Kemo Sabe..."
LR: "Yes, my Faithful Companion?"
T: "Kemo Sabe, as I stared into the crackling campfire, beneath the starry sky, its bright yellow colors brought a vision, a thought-picture..."
LR: "And what did you see, my Native American friend? Let us put more sticks on the fire. And have another marshmallow. Where'd you find these sticks anyway, in this desert?"
T: "Potawatomi tribal lore, Tenderfoot.  In my vision I saw gold coins, like the ones that you gave to the bartender at the Longhorn Saloon in Wichita yesterday. We got firewater to wash away the trail dust."
LR: "You speak the truth, One-Feather, whiskey is not cheap, even the rot-gut at that joint."
T: "Just wondering, O Masked One, where did you get the wampum?  We have no jobs, we are busy all the time pursuing outlaws."
LR: "Yes, we do good deeds and never ask for a reward, which we deserve. You must remember how we nabbed Jesse James, Billy the Kid, and Mark Twain, well, Twain was a mistake, he looked like Poncho Villa, and Butch Cassidy and Sunpants..."
T: "Sundance Kid, Kemo Sabe, my Pal."
LR: "Sundance, tracked them over rock, Babe!"   
T: "Yes, this became a lifetime activity, which I believe was your idea, Kemo Sabe, if I remember correctly. You were pretty miffed at the high crime rate in the territories and after I nursed you back to health , nothing would do but obsessive chasing after outlaws, with that silly mask and that white hat that shows dirt if you just look at it.  But about the gold shiny coins..."
LR: "Well, since you asked, Old Buddy, you see, sometimes we recover stolen property, like that time the Dodge City Stage Company got robbed and we tracked down the Snarely Gibbins Gang and trapped them in that box canyon and then gave back that gold shipment, well, we didn't give back ALL the gold, get it?  I didn't tell you all these years because I thought you might not approve."
T: "KEMO SABE!  It is against the tribal ethics of my people from ancient times- Great Spirit frowns upon wampum stealing except from other tribes: that's Commandment Number 5, Number 6:  Mimes shall be exiled. Number 11: Thou shalt not make licorice jelly beans. I don't remember the others."
LR: "But Good Pally, we needed to buy grub, those fried lizards ain't steak, you know, and we need hay and oats for Silver and Scout and bullets cost a good buck, especially silver bullets from ACME Company, those crooks!"
T: "Well, now I see why you always wear that black mask, Kemo Sabe, it all kinda fits. By the way, we've been doing this chasing bandits shtick since 1860, aren't you getting tired of it?"
LR: Don't move, Ton-ton. There's a rattlesnake right by your box of Twinkies! I'll get him!"
BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! Click. Click. Click.  
T: KEMO SABE! You missed him and shot up my Twinkies!"
LR: "So my gun hand shakes a little; give me a break, I'm 123 years old next month!"
T: "With regards to this larceny you have admitted to, I must go to the Sacred Mountain for one moon and smoke the Wisdom Pipe to decide this question of ethics.  Or... wait a minute!  I have a vision in my mind: from now on, you give me half of the gold wampum, then I can buy turquoise jewelry at the Navajo Souvenir Shop in Tombstone. I always wanted one of those Teddy Bears, too. Like yours, Kemo Sabe."

Chief Rusty Marvel of the Caratunk Police Department answers the phone:
"Police Department, Chief Marvel speaking."
"Hello, Chief, it's Scotty. Listen, there's a big bomb here! Dispatcher sent me to MacGregor's farm and he ran into an huge bomb in his field! Hit it with his plow then dug it up with his big front-loader, didn't explode for some reason, just buried in the muddy field."
"A bomb? Has it got four tail fins and got 'Mark 8' stamped on it?"
"It's rusty, but I can read 'Mark 8', yes, and got four fins."
"This is amazing, Scotty! It must be the lost bomb from 1970! You know I was in the 78th Air Wing and we had an accidental bomb release in that area, never found, it's a live one Scotty, be careful!  One wrong move and it's KABLOOEY! We're in luck, Scotty, 'cause I was in the air force, I know all about those Mark 8's. It's loaded with TX88 the super high explosive. They discontinued that TX88 ...too sensitive, goes off at the drop of a hat, Baby! Is it ticking, Scotty?"
"I don't hear any ticking. Chief. "
 "It's a delayed action bomb, if it starts ticking that means it's been triggered and will go KABLOOEY in 5 minutes."
"Chief, I wish you'd stop saying KABLOOEY!"
"Now, Scotty, all we've got to do is disarm it by taking off that little access plate held by four hex nuts.  Then cut the right wires.  Cut the wrong wire and KABLOOEY! See that plate by the tail fins?"
"But I got no tools, Chief. I got an idea, MacGregor and I will just RUN LIKE HELL away and then we get a bomb squad from the Air Force who owns it, don't they?"
"No, we can't leave a dangerous bomb like that.  Ask Farmer MacGregor if he's got a wrench."
"OK, Chief, he had toolbox in his front-loader.  The nuts won't budge, rusted a lot." 
"Here's what you do, hit 'em with a hammer, that'll loosen them."
"I don't think I should be hammering on a bomb, Chief."
"You're right, Officer Scotty, hammering might be just enough to trigger the bomb KABLOOEY!  What's that Bang, bang noise?"
"Chief, MacGregor hammered with his hammer and took off the nuts and the panel.  There's a ticking noise now."
"Oh, better cut the wires quick to disable the bomb. You got five minutes.  You see a green wire and a blue wire and a red wire?"
"Yes, Chief I got wire cutters ready..."
Riiiinnng!
"Wait a minute, Scotty, got a call....Hello, this is Chief Marvel."
"Is this the Police Department? This is Elizabeth Buttercup.  I live on Leafy Lane."
"Yes, Ma'am, what's the problem?"
"Chief Marvel, I hate to bother you with this, but my cat Lucifer ran up a tree and won't come down. Can you save him?"
"Ma'am, cats often climb trees, and they don't like to come down so much, gotta have to kinda back down, but they will after awhile."
"Chief, what wire do I cut? It's ticking..."
"Oh, Ms. Buttercup, can I call you back, working on this bomb problem right now..."
"Oh, of course, I'll give you my number, 809-765-0987, there's a bomb in your office?  By the way, your name sounds familiar, did you go to Northland High School around 1980?"
"Chief, what wire do I cut? It's ticking..."
"Why yes, Ms. Buttercup... wait,  you're not Betty Buttercup, the Prom Queen of 1980 are you?"
"Oh Rusty! it's you, I was in your remedial English Class, remember?
"Officer Scotty, what's that huff, puff, puff sound?"
"That's me and MacGregor running as fast as we can."
KABLAAAM!!!
"What was that loud explosion sound?"
"Bomb went off, Chief, knocked us down, but we're OK."
CLATTER-CRASH-BANG!
"What was that clank and clatter sound...?"
"That was the front-loader coming back down."
CRASH-CRASH-CRUNCH-GRUNK-CATUNGE-DOINK-CRUNCH!
"What was that falling rocks avalanche sound?"
"That was the concrete silo falling on Mr. MacGregor's barn full of farm machinery."
"Well, Scotty, it looks like the Caratunk Police Department can chalk up a successful bomb disposal!"

                                                                At the Movies
"I've seen it before, Shirley."
The girls sat right behind me at the movies the other night and they whispered loud enough to hear.  I was lucky; I didn't miss a thing because Laverne explained it all before it happened.
It was a western.  Laverne was talking:  "See that one in the black vest?  I call him Blackie...he's got a hidden gun...a Derringer, a little gun.  He'll pull it out on Gary Cooper, but it won't work 'cause Gary is faster...THERE HE GOES!" she whispered.  
BANG! BANG!
Sure enough, Blackie whips out his sneaky, hidden gun and miraculously Gary has his Colt .45 out first and fires and Blackie goes down as cards and drinks go flying.
I wondered what would happen next, but not for long.  Laverne told us in a low voice, "The fat guy with the bull whip is friends with Blackie...watch him... he'll lash out and get Gary's gun hand.  But don't worry, Gary will grab the whip away and knock fatty around with his fists."
Indeed, up on the screen, Gary proceeds to knock fatty around with his fists.
I listened carefully as Laverne continued.  "Now, that's it for the barroom, but Blackie's only wounded and he has a gang."
Yes, Blackie plots revenge and riflemen wait for Gary to return to town.
"See that guy behind the barrel?  Watch him." Lavern whispered.
"There are four of them, they'll get him for sure!" said Shirley.  I had to agree with Shirley, I would have bet on even your average outlaw gang of four against a sitting duck on a horse clip-clopping down Main Street, but let's see what our Hollywood scriptwriters have to say. 
At this point,  the guy behind the barrel leaps up and fires as Gary arrives on Dobbin.
"But he'll get his... watch...THERE'S GOES GARY!" Laverne whispered.  
Before you know it, Gary fires his Colt and the rifle goes flying and Barrel Guy goes down and water spurts from bullet holes in the barrel.
More gunfire ensues, but you will be glad to know that Gary survives, after firing eleven bullets from his six-gun without reloading. The smoke clears and the gang has retreated, wounded and chastened, but likely still available for mischief in the future. The hail of .30 caliber rifle bullets has mostly missed Gary, except for his left arm, which is being bandaged expertly by the comely Molly. The town appears populated by meek souls who depend on good-hearted strangers who are handy with a gun to protect them from swarms of bad characters.  They offer Gary the vacant office of Town Sheriff, with good working hours, a retirement plan and health insurance, which he is likely to need.  Doc patches up his wound and Molly helps him recuperate while he thinks about his so far meaningless life.  Would things get better if he stays in this dusty hick burg, even with the presence of the charming Molly who seems to like him?
However, in the end, he can't stick around and marry pert and perky Molly since in these parts he is bound to be constantly challenged to gun duels because of his fast-draw reputation. 
I know this because Laverne explained that, too.  Let's reflect a bit.  Was Gary a good prospect for Molly?  He didn't seem to have a job or even look for one, preferring to hang around gambling in a saloon.  Molly, forget that drifter and set your sights on the fellow with the gold watch who owns the bank.  What a nice touch, in the end we see Gary riding off into the fading sunset.  Why is he going to ride at night, can he even see the trail in the pitch dark?

"Hello, scrap yard, Palooka speaking!"

"Yes, listen, I signed up for the Planet 1313 Vacation Special and the Autospace IV ship landed  but the space ship skidded and crashed into the house of Mr. S. Kimo.  This Planet 1313 person is not very friendly and is threatening me with a sharp stick!"

"Buddy, do I get you right you got an Autospace IV you want to sell? Those old models ain't worth much. How bad is it from the accident?"

"It's got a lot of dents, but see, I don't own it, I just rode in it and now I'm stuck on Planet 1313!

"Sorry, Pal, we only operate in the Sector 246 local area. Click BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ."

Hosmer's Autospace IV has big dents in the side, but is still operable.  He switches from autopilot to manual control.
"Good Grief! I never operated one of these before!" he muttered to himself. Its outward appearance was that of a 1953 Cadillac.  Hosmer pushed and pulled some of the levers and steering wheel and the Autospace IV backed away from the angry native and kept going over the icy plain. By trial and error he brought it to a stop.

His SpaceCom receiver rang.  It was Roz from Planet One News.
"Hello Hosmer? Are you working on the travel column- the Planet 1313 vacation trip?"
"Yes, and the ship crashed and I'm stranded here on this ice planet!"
"Can you still drive the spaceship? It's not an Autospace IV is it? Those are antique junkers, the autopilot never works right, they fly into brick walls and things.  Don't worry, we'll send a space taxi to get you when you're done with the vacay report.  The boss wants your report for next Sunday, can you do that? And try to make it up-beat, you know. I have to go, meeting Nikky for lunch!"

The heater still worked in the dented caddy-lookalike. Hosmer huddled close to it. He called the automated copy desk and typed in his first vacation trip news: 
"Copy for The Happy Wanderer:  Greetings Dear Readers! My comfortable Autospace IV arrived exactly on time at the beautiful Planet 1313 at the luxurious Sandy Paradise Hotel right at the valet parking drop-off and I stepped out onto the red carpet. The blue water of a big pond gently washed up on the white sandy beach where 1313 people wetted their bodies. I was escorted to a spacious room with a panoramic view."

He read over the Galaxy Cruise Tourist Guide: "Our Galaxy Cruise staff has thoroughly researched Planet 1313. Most of it is underwater, but there is some dry land which is populated by animals. On your vacation you will likely need to interact with some animals and the best would be fairly large animals who walk on two legs, not on all fours as we do, and are called humans who may have a primitive language. They cluster in tribes which all fight with other tribes, except for brief periods of peace.  Use your speech translator, which we have prepared to translate many of 1313 languages.

 Do not be alarmed by the humans' appearance; they are not of the lizard family as we are and they are all very dumb.  Most of what they mutter is nonsense, but we must deal with these yokels as they guard their hovels and primitive living structures jealously.  Always be polite. 

Our exploration teams report these humans may be alarmed by our green lizard appearance and may bark or emit loud sounds, and even operate crude devices called Glocks which they all carry. These Glocks project lumps of a heavy metal called musket balls, but they bounce off our tough lizard shell-plates. 

You have been provided with valuable items you can trade with the primitive 1313 natives: shiny beads, bubble gum, mirrors, wind-up chattering teeth, and dribble glasses. Also a quantity of coins made of pure black plastic which is highly valued everywhere. Also we have supplied packets of sand, which we manufacture at great expense on Planet One." 

Another call on the SpaceCom: "Hey, Pal! Are you Hosmer? Roz gave me your number.  I'm here on 1313, names Benny, I can give you some tips about this place.
 I'm at this place called Vegas. Unbelievable sand all around!  You don't have to buy it in little packages! Humans' medium of exchange is green printed tickets, and I got bundles of them by a simple method.  
The hotels here have game rooms and I went to one game called roulette.  I used my translator to talk to this guy who was losing.  I says, give me some of those chips and I will tell you how to win.  He did and I just used mind control to make his number come up.  Did it a few times, he was really happy.  I soon had a suitcase full of green tickets. I found humans  are a little reluctant to talk to a giant lizard, but when they see the green stuff, they get friendly and eager to please."
 
Benny gave Hosmer Vegas coordinates, and by using the autopilot he soon arrived there in front of the Sands Hotel.
He easily recognized his green new friend in the crowd. Benny showed him how he could spread sand in his room to sleep on and how to call room service.
 They stretched out on lounge chairs by the pool and soaked up some sun.  
"You know, Hosmer, this is a great vacation, but I don't look forward to going back to my job hitting rocks with a hammer to make sand on Planet One.  We could start a housing development here. There are square miles of sand dunes we can get cheap and Planet One folks, being lizards, would love it here."
"It's a deal, Benny, you are one smart reptile!"

*************************************************************************************************

The deal with publishers: We print it- now you go and sell it!  Lots of flying around.  I don't fear flying, but sometimes I just want to knock on the metal outside to see if it's sturdy or not. (As thin as 0.04 inches, if you're wondering.)   I can imagine a newspaper report:  "Among the passengers who were sucked out of the gaping hole in Flight 777 and flung headlong to their deaths were (a minor gangster), (a porno B film actor), (Dade County, FL Bass Fishing Champion), (a sausage company executive). and gagman Davy Separkis."  Recently I was headed for Sodbuster, Oklahoma, and was greeted by a stewardess at the plane entrance.
"Is that a parachute you're carrying, Sir?  You can't board with a parachute."
Well, it WAS a parachute, and I explained that my sister and I were shopping at an army surplus store and we both bought parachutes. Not expensive and a nice addition to my collection of quirky items, (shrunken head, Calvin Coolidge Campaign Mug, Red Ryder BB Gun, Soligen Steel Throwing Knife, wind-up chattering teeth, Elvis painting on black velvet, etc.). I tried to talk Amy out of hers: "What are you going to do with that? I asked. Of course, I wanted to avoid others owning the same freak artifacts I had because that diminished their value.  Who's going to say, "Gosh, you have a _______!?" if everybody has one? 
People were crowding past me and scowling, so I retreated. But I couldn't help remembering war movies. Didn't  all the crew members have parachutes?  In my mind, I pictured being on a plane with all four engines on fire over the Rocky Mountains. I had thoughtfully brought a parachute and I would say, "Excuse me, Miss, I have my own chute and would you please open the emergency door, and I'll just pop out and float down, OK?"
Well, I got to Sodbuster, my parachute uselessly riding in the luggage compartment, and soon was doing some book signing at the Trail's End General Store.  First in line was a nervous thin fellow with a cowboy hat.  He handed me a 10-inch-high figurine of a man holding a microphone.
"This is for you," he said, "It's you, see?" 
As much as I like to get gifts, I wasn't sure about this.
"See, I make porcelain figurines, and this is one of my Comedian Series, see your name is on the base right there."
It seems he had a store in Las Vegas stocked with such items. Vegas tourists will buy anything. 
"Thank you, Barney,"  I said.  His name was Barney.
"Thank you, but it doesn't look like me, more like Wayne Newton," I said.
"Well, it is from the Wayne Newton mold. I changed his face to have your flat half-smile look."
"And he's holding a microphone like a singer, I don't do that."
"Sir," I continued, "you know, you can't just use a person's image and name like that without their permission."
"Well, I didn't think you'd mind- can I have your permission?"
"No,"  I said, signalling the next person in line to step up.
Well, Barney wilted like a pansie transplanted in Death Valley.
With a sigh, I said, "Oh, go ahead." And I signed his book, "You have my permission to sell Wayne Newton figurines."
Barney happily left.
"Wait, I called, "is Wayne Newton a comedian?"
"Well, no, but there aren't many comedians, so I added singers."
Next in line was a 50ish prim lady with a Buster Keaton stone face.
"You have a stone face," I said, "want to hear a joke, and maybe smile?"
"No," she said.
I said, "I made up this joke: The salesgirl in the appliance store was kind of a flirt.  I gave her a tiny wink, and she gave me a microwave."
She didn't laugh.
"You didn't laugh," I said.
"Not funny," she said.
The person behind her said, "I thought it was funny."
The person behind him said, "What was the joke?"
I continued signing. About ten people after that, a man asked me, "Want to hear a joke?"
I asked, "Is it about a flirty salesgirl?"
"How did you know?" the man asked.
"I have certain powers of perception," I said, modestly.
Next in line was a huge man with a huge smile.
"Are you an undertaker?" I asked.
"No, a chiropractor- 27 years!"
"Are chiropractors scam artists?" I enquired.
"How can you ask such a question?" he replied, backing away.
"Didn't Jesus denounce chiropractors in  the Gospel of Matthew, chapter 21, verses 12-13?"
"No, He didn't!"
Of course, I was just making that up, impish little demon that I am sometimes.
"Yes, along with mimes and money-changers."
"No, no, can't be," my victim protested.
"Did you adjust bones of any famous people?"
"Well, yes, Rodney Dangerfield."
"Oh my Gosh. Let me guess his problem. Was it his neck?"
"How did you know?"
"I have certain powers," I said modestly.
I was going to give my Newton/Sedaris figurine to the last person in line as a reward for waiting so long, but then I thought I might find a use for it; a small shrine perhaps?
On a stay at Emerald Isle, my sister-in-law said, "Oh, can I have it? I love Wayne Newton."
"Sure," I said.
"Danke Schoen!" she said.

                                      This Happy Day! the Weekly Column of Joy
                                                         by Suzy Sparkle
Oh my Dear Readers I'm excited!  See this beautiful mauve yarn- is mauve a color? Oh such a subtle purpley soft shade- of course you can't see it- or maybe you can- here look, printing press magic is bringing it to your eyes!
                                               **insert purple yarn pix here**
Now for this week's project we are going to make some cute baby booties using the magic of knitting!  So easy, really.  I have my pointy sticks here which are called "knitting needles"- just hold the yarn with your left forefinger and make a little loop around with the other finger and then do a backward motion called a purl- oh my! my cat Fluffy-Luv wants to help- OH BLEEP! BLEEEP!, she's got my ball of yarn!  Let go bleeping bleep cat - MEO-EOWW!  MEO-OWE! Fluffy doesn't like it when I yank the yarn from her bleeping fangs! Bleep, BLEEP it, cat!
OHH! CRASH! BLEEEP! bleeping cat knocked over my 1939 World's Fair Snow Globe and it broke on the floor bleep, bleep , bleep- my World's Fair globe with the Trylon and Perisphere, that globe and pyramid thing- what was that all about, anyway? Bleeping globe and pyramid! Bleeping Robert Moses!  Bleeping bleep Thomas Dewey with his bleeping little mustache!
Ok, calm down now,- here's my Basset Hound, Flapjack, here to comfort me when he sees me crying- Give me a hug, Flapjack!- Don't bump the little table- Oh BLEEP!- clumsy bleep bleeping mutt! Knocked over my porcelain Roy Rogers on his horse and broke off his arm with hat waving! bleep, bleep!  
Oh, but have to pause now... maybe Crazy Glue can fix it.  Yes, Dear Readers we will continue with the booties... WOOF!  Bleeping dumb dog! You ain't nothin' but a hound dog!  Sometimes I write songs... hmmm, maybe that could be one.  "You ain't never caught a rabbit!"  I'll have to think about that.   So you see Dear Readers, just keep going with the knit one, purl two, knit one, purl two, and keep going like that. 
Now, there's been a little time lapse here.  I've been knitting and I had a refreshing glass of wine also, which can be soooo soothing on my nerves.  
Here's a little Suzy Secret:  go to your fridge and get an egg.  Now use this egg and knit around it to form the round shape of your bootie.  See, you stretch the bootie over the egg OH, BLEEP! IT BROKE!! I pressed too hard, the bleeping squishy egg glop made a slimy MESS all over bootie and ME! Flapjack...get down! you can't have that egg!  NORWOOD!  Help me! Stop watching that bleeping football game and help me with this... What?...I don't care about bleeping five yard bleeping LINE!
Must pause a bit now, Readers.
Ah, I'm back. I washed the bootie and myself and changed clothes and had a bit more wine.  Here we go to finish the knitting...knit one, purl two, knit one, purl two....
Now, it's later, see, all done with the first bootie. Notice how it has the shape of a foot.  Here's the hole at the top, then a heel part, too, and the toe...wait there's no bleeping TOE!  It's open at both bleeping ends! OH, BEEEP!! 
Now it's time for Suzy to relax and finish this wine, oh, maybe pour some more.  Well, I think we got a pretty good result, except for the toe, so we'll wrap this up for this week and we'll see you next time with another This Happy Day! where we do another bleeping Suzy project if I can think of one.

Billy Bob stopped by, "Who wants to go with me to the ball game today? Terriers vs. the Tampa Turtles?"
Well, I didn't want to go.  My wife said she was planning to watch some paint dry instead, and Andy couldn't go because he was going to make some toast, so I went with the big cry-baby to  the game just to shut him up about it.
We got there late, and by the time we got beers and hot dogs, it was already the fifth inning, and the Turtles pitchers were getting slammed with hit after hit, Terriers were the underdogs, but they were up 7 runs to 0.
As we found our seats, Flatfoot McGee hit a cream puff pitch from the Turtles best pitcher, Gooney Bird, and the manager headed for the mound. That was it for the Bird.  Casey, the manager, looked at the bullpen and touched his left arm. There was a pause, and the pitcher came out walking very awkwardly, and a man with a suit and tie came with him, kind of guiding him. The crowd hushed; it was a CHIMPANZE in a Turtles uniform! Glove on his right hand, a lefty. 
"Billy Bob, see that man with the chimp?  That's B.F. Skinner, I was in one of his classes; he trained chickens to dance, and now he must have trained that big chimp to pitch!"
Out came the opposing manager to complain, and there was a lot of chit chat with all the umps, but I guess they couldn't find a rule against chimp players, so pretty soon the chimp threw the usual warm up pitches, and they looked pretty good, and you know chimps have pretty long arms and a roar went up each time his pitch went smack into the catcher's mitt, he could throw heat, that guy! 
Well, who was up for the Terriers? Blackjack Casio stepped into the box.
"He can hit any fastball, B.B., watch." I said.
But the wily chimp threw a curve that seemed to come from third base but hit the strike zone dead center and Blackie whiffed. Then a change-up and another blazing fastball and Blackie was done.
"Billy, those chimp long fingers can put a super spin on the ball, he gets that boomerang curve," I advised Billy from my superior baseball knowledge.
Well, Bonzo got 6 batters in a row out and the Turtles hitters smacked in two runs. "I think we need two more beers and hot dogs, Billy, what do you think? " I said.  B. concurred.
It was now the 7th inning.
Whoa, now the Terriers were playing their surprise card- the batter is a GORILLA in a Terrier's uniform!
How can this be? Did they rush to the zoo down the street and get a gorilla? Where did they get a uniform that big?  The huge primate is slouched at the plate and holds the bat at the wrong end; it looks like a Popsicle stick. Here's the fastball; it's a pesky insect to him, he swats the ball into deep left with his big hand, he's a southpaw! A fast runner could get a double, but he just stands there.  Now one of the Terriers comes running out waving a bunch of bananas, running to first, and Mr. G gives chase.  You wouldn't think a big gorilla could run so fast.  Here's the throw, it pulls Castenada off the bag, and when the dust clears, the gorilla is standing on first peeling a banana; safe!
 Manager comes out and argues with cluster of umpires. Apparently there is no rule about running around the field holding bananas, so the game goes on.  Hey, it's clouding over, will it rain?
What next? Will they bring in Mr. Ed as a pinch runner? No, it's a human, Rusty Gates, to run for the big ape.  By the way, that ape needs cleats if he has to run the bases.
Now Bonzo the chimp is still throwing heat and he easily retires the side. 
"B. we need another beer and hot dog, you think?" I say.  While we were getting those, they got ready to start playing again.  Oh no, they came to Bonzo in the batting order, they'll have to let him bat to keep him pitching.  Did B.F. teach him to bat?
Here's the first pitch- fastball over the plate. Bonzo just stands there.
Whoa.  starting to rain...
Next pitch...Bonzo is just holding his bat and the ball hits it. It's a bunt!
Now it's a downpour...pitcher, Slim Pickens, charges for the ball, but skids on the mud.
"Run, Bonzo, run," I shout.
Bonzo runs, but toward third base!
"Not that way! Run to first!"
The pitcher falls flat and collides with the catcher!
"Run Bonzo! Run for it!" I yell.
"Wake up! Wake up!," my wife says.
"Oh my," I sputter, blinking and sitting up in bed.
"I had this crazy dream," I say, "it was the Terriers vs. the Turtles, and the Turtles put in this CHIMPANZE to pitch, and they couldn't get a hit off him, he threw fastballs and looping curves, and, listen, I'll start at the beginning... See, the Turtles were behind 0 to 6 or was it 0 to 7...are you listening?"
"See, this chimp had really long arms... I remember it clearly..."
My wife:  zzzzzzzz
"Now I'll tell you the whole thing, OK? Billy Bob and I both went, had beers and hot dogs, you know how they come around calling 'Get yer red hots' ? Are you listening?"
Marnie:  ZZZZZZZZZZZ

Kamikaze Squadron Commander Tojo looked up, surprised.
"Lt. Moto, is that you?  I thought you went on your Kamikaze mission this morning."
"Yessir, I have completed my mission successfully and have just now landed on runway 9."
"Are you sure you completed all items on your Kamikaze Mission Checklist?"
"Oh, yes, Commander, first I did the pre-flight checklist, the fuel level, check tires, tested flaps and rudder, engine warm-up and cleaned my windshield with Windex, then took off into the wind for efficient takeoff.  Then I climbed to 8000 meters elevation and proceeded to sector 208 and made visual contact with evil American fleet. Following my checklist I descended to 100 meters and selected the largest evil American warship and put my high explosive fuze in armed position, and then quickly climbed to 8000 meters and returned to base."
"Ah so, Lt. Moto, I think we have identified the problem.  Kamikaze Checklist item #19 is 'Crash glorious Kamikaze Plane into evil American ship' not 'Return to base'."
"Aah, Commander, I see you are correct,  it was dark in the cockpit in the pre-dawn hour and I misread the Directive #19!" 
"Did you turn on the cockpit overhead light, a product of the superior Sony Corporation? Those bulbs are 'As Bright as the Rising Sun' as they say in their ads."
"Dear Commander, I did not think of that, I was distracted by anti-aircraft fire making holes in my plane, and the air-to-air rocket that came through my windshield at that time."
"Lt., by the way, while you were on your heroic mission, our Beloved Emperor has surrendered to the evil Americans... but in his wisdom has saved face. Instead of being shot by a firing squad he will pretend to still be the Emperor but in actuality an American named Charlie McCarthy will be in charge."
"That's terrible news, Commander! I have accidentally seen the American propaganda magazine 'Life' with pix of Charlie McCarthy and he is really small, it's insulting to be governed by such a shrimp!"
"That's the bad news, Lt. Moto, it appears it will be a puppet government for us, but here's the good news, the surrender does not take effect for an hour, so you have plenty of time to complete your Kamikaze mission, this time following Directive #19 correctly, if you hurry, and thus you will not get the demerit I would otherwise have to give you!"
"That's wonderful, Commander, I go now, farewell...wait, my plane is almost empty of fuel and you know how slow the refueling process is, a half hour at least, so there will not be time for my mission, you see."
"Au Contraire, my Dear Lt., we just today installed the new fast fueling pumps, I don't know how we were such Silly Billies not to do it until now!"
"That's good news, Commander!  I will be able to get back in my plane, a shambled wreck that it is from all the enemy fire, and complete my mission...I have put on my thin leather helmet and hurry now... but wait, I just this moment remembered that my plane is due for an oil change which takes 45 minutes, Rats!"
"Of course, you are right, maintenance according to the Kawasaki engine schedule is important.  Let me check my Kamikaze Plane Roster...Here, you are in luck, Lt., plane number 777 is all fueled and available for you! Its nickname is 'Lucky 7'. "
"Very good, here I go,...have you seen my gloves? I know I put them down here somewhere."
"Wait, Lt. Moto, a messenger has come..."
"Gentlemen, sorry to interrupt, but I bring you a message to your Kamikaze Squadron from our Beloved Emperor:  He says 'So sorry about the surrender, better luck next time! Here are my final orders: All available personnel, that includes you, Commander Tojo, are to hasten to fly a Kamikaze mission against the evil Americans'."
"Messenger, here is my message back to His Majesty, The Emperor: 'Thank you, Dear Emperor! I and my men will take off on our missions!'" 
"One moment, Messenger...I am checking the Kamikaze Plane Roster to see what is available...Oh Dear Me,  I see it's No Can Do on the  K missions as there are zero Zero's available, due to the high casualty rate for Kamikaze Squadron Planes, you see. Please report 'Sorry, Dear Emperor, better luck next time'."  

******************************************************************************************************

                                                                 My Yale Speech

Did I ever tell you about my Yale speech?  Long time ago.  Unbeknownst to me, there was a famous physicist with the same name as me and about same age and we looked alike, too. It led to a mix-up. In the usually dismal collection in our mailbox was an invitation to speak at a Yale Physics Department colloquium! I didn't get many invitations to give speeches and this one included a monetary honorarium, too, so of course I graciously accepted.  I was finally receiving some recognition, I thought, beyond my local reputation in Padanaram, NY, for my fishing and hunting and so on. Padanaram is not big enough to be a town, it's just a place. My wife and I run a little convenience store with P.O. attached there, well, my dear wife does most of it, but I refill the soft drink cooler and sit by the pot-bellied stove and tell stories to customers, if they'll listen. Like how I happened to catch that really big fish in '53 and it was in the local paper, maybe you saw that article.  
For Yale, my wife made me wear some old dried-up shoes I had instead of my comfortable logging boots, and I showed up at the appointed time.  I had some 35mm color slides (well, just two) to go with my talk, but they didn't have a slide projector, my wife went back to the car to get the one we brought as you never know, you should be prepared and they got it plugged in, but no screen so just projected on a flat wall. Of course I wasn't ready for it yet as I hadn't even said a word up til then. Some nice general applause as I was introduced, and I had no trouble talking, started off with being born and then being a young kid and how we had mud week in the spring, no school 'cause roads were too muddy to travel and how we ran around barefoot in the woods during logging operations and got very sticky feet that turned black when the dirt stuck to the pine pitch from the branches. I explained about how to go out after midnight for bullheads, and what bait to use, which was those large earthworms called nightcrawers, which we sold, by the way, if we had 'em at the store.  And about the time I knocked over our kerosene lantern off the rowboat into the water and how dark it was after that trying to row our way back at three in the morning from the lake. Wifey waved her hand from where she was sitting by the projector, so that was good, I said, please let us see slide number one and it was of me upside down holding that prize pike from 1953, but dear wife quickly fixed it right and the other was me frying the fish. See, that was part of what I had to know, to be a guide for the city folks that came around looking for an Adirondack guide which is what I was and pretty good at it if I do say so myself.  Like how to prepare bullheads for frying different than, say perch or sunfish or pike, you know. Do you know those round mints called Mason Mints? I had developed a special way to form the foil wrapper into the shape of a tiny goblet!  I could make a goose, and a tiny pistol, too, but my goblet was my best one.  So I explained all about that to the folks at Yale. 
After about a half hour a fellow handed me a note from the moderator: "Get to the big bang."  That puzzled me a moment, but then I thought, he must know about that time I was at summer camp and happened to have bullets in my pocket and I put two .45 caliber bullets in the camp microwave.  "Loser" Brown was heating up his pastrami sandwich and he didn't see me put the bullets in, too.  BLAM! BLAM! the microwave jumped two feet in the air and the door flew open and Loser was covered in pastrami.  I asked, "Did you put that sandwich in with foil wrapping?"  "Yes," Loser admitted.  The counselors spent a long time explaining how we should always read the instructions and how you should never put metal things in a microwave, so poor Loser got the blame and I just kept quiet about the two bullets.   
About then another note was passed to me, saying: "Get to the physics."  Well, whose speech is this, anyway, I thought, but tried to be accommodating as really they were paying me something to blab to them.  I pointed out what must have happened as the blast of radiation heated the bullet, the little primer would explode first, just like when fired in a gun, which in turn would ignite the gunpowder which reaction creates a lot of hot gas which expands really, really fast, too fast to just leak out of whatever it's in like a bullet casing and a microwave box. At this point the moderator spoke up and said that was all the time there was for my talk and was even running over a bit and there would be no time, unfortunately, for the usual questions from the audience.  One fellow popped up, though, "One quick question, please, do you think that an energetic electron cloud dominated in the 6 microsec time frame of the Big Bang?"
I did not know any good answer but didn't want to be embarrassed, so I decided to just wing it and said, "Yes, a huge electron surge dominated!"  "Oh, I'm glad to hear that you agree, it's of course a very unpopular position, even crackpot opinion, but at least you and I agree, Doctor!" 
I was beginning to be glad we were finishing up when a woman piped up, "Just, Doctor, could you comment on the Salisbury Conjecture regarding muons at the half-second horizon?  Is it true or fairy-tale nonsense?"
"Madam, I would not wish to disparage a colleague's opinion. but in this case I would have to go with fairy-tale nonsense."
"Bravo, Doctor!" she exclaimed.
"Doctor!" came another voice, did your Mason Mint goblet inspire your "Shiny Goblet" proposal for the 
shape of the McDermett gas cloud?"
I paused briefly, and then, "Yes, you know sometimes you ponder for years, and then suddenly it all becomes clear in a flash!"  This was greeted with applause and then the moderator stepped forward and brought a shiny silvery goblet.  "We are pleased to award to you this goblet engraved with your name and this occasion of your talk;  it is made of the super-alloy which you invented."
"Oh, you shouldn't have!" I said modestly as I grabbed it out of his hand and made my exit, waving to the crowd.

Tap, tap...tap, tap, tap...
A man in a gray fedora is hunched over a big manual Royal typewriter, typing with two fingers.  It's a filler story for the evening edition. The frowning man in the wrinkled suit is Clark Kent, reporter for The Daily Planet.
"Hey, Chief, I don't believe this ditzy dame who claims she saw Elvis in the 8th Avenue subway whistling 'Heartbreak Hotel' !"
"Just write it, Clark, we need a story!"
Just then Clark hears a distant siren with his super hearing- maybe it's a job for Superman! He rushes to a nearby storeroom and whips off his glasses, tie, suit coat and shirt, revealing his blue, yellow and red Superman suit- he turns around- Lois Lane is there getting some typing paper!
"Whaaat? Clark it's you- you're Superman!  I see your Superman suit! Nobody would ever think it even though you have the exact same height and build and same face and voice and you are never seen together!"
"Don't say anything, Lois!" 
They rush out of the room.
"Hey, Perry- look at this- Clark Kent is really Superman!"
"Shush, will you, Lois!"
Then Jimmy Olsen appears.
"What did you say? Clark Kent is Superman's secret identity??"
Superman says, "Don't tell anybody!" as he flies out the window.
Superman flies over to 7th Avenue and leaps over some tall buildings to arrive at the site of the wailing sirens.  It turns out it is not really a job for Superman; it was an old lady jaywalking and three squad cars handled it.
A gloomy Superman sat on a nearby park bench and pondered, thinking to himself: "I'll need a new secret identity, but I don't have any occupational skills except newspaper work and actually, Lois has been covering for me for years, rewriting all my stories."
There was a discarded newspaper on the bench.  Superman glanced at it and with his xray vision looked through all the layers of the pages and spotted an ad for APTITUDE TESTING. He noted the address and stored it in his photographic memory and soon was on his way there, leaping over some medium high buildings on the way.  Alas, he completed the test, and the results showed he wasn't qualified for anything but hobo or politician. 
This quandary he explained to Lois by phone.
"Listen, Superman, I have an idea, meet me at The Daily Planet and we will disguise you as my sister, LILY LANE!  Perry will hire you because you are my sister, see? I'll get you a wig and a dress and they'll never know it's you!"
"Lois, that will never work!"
Later, at The Daily Planet storeroom, Superman struggles to put on a red dress with puffy sleeves.
"They had lots of dresses at The Salvation Army Store, if this doesn't fit we'll go back...wait, it's not so bad...I'll zip it up in back for you. Here, put on these high heels, my, you've got big feet haven't you!"
Lois produced a blonde wig and it covered his dark hair except for a curl on his forehead.  
"No, no, no, you've used too much lipstick, Superman, you've got clown lips! You've got to use just a little and smoosh your lips together to make it even."
Just then a police siren sounded.
"Oh, oh,  gotta go, job for Superman, Lois...help me get out of this dress- I can't unzip it in back! How do you women zip up the back zipper, anyway??  Take this wig...quick, unzip me from this red dress, Lois! Get me out of this dress!..."
Then Superman woke up from his dream.
"...Get me out, Lois...Whaat? I was dreaming!  Oh my Gosh! wait.. what's this red dress?  - oh it's my red cape!  I forgot to take off my cape when I went to bed.  What is this blasted cape good for, anyway!? Ooh, my aching head!  That's the last time I stop at Duffy's Tavern after work!"

Diary, I have this great idea for a novel, tentative title: "The Big Fish" See, this kind of gruff boat captain named Captain Baha is sitting with his feet dangling in the water and along comes this big pink fish and it bites his leg off!  So Mr. Grumpy swears a blue streak and he's really peeved at this fish, but let me ask you, what do you expect dangling your feet with dangerous fish and big lobsters probably too? Captain takes off to find this pink fish in order to wreak revenge by stabbing it with a harpoon, which is narrative weak spot... he's never gonna find one fish in the entire ocean! Maybe it can be a lake or Mississippi River or pond, I'll think about that, so off he goes and it's a big fish so he has a big boat and crew who are foolish enough to go on this crazy chase.  

I think I'll set this thing in old sailing days there's more stuff going on with sailors climbing and hauling on sails and talking about mizzen something and belaying pipes and stuff, well lots of chance for desperate sailing around with storms happening to spice up a dull trip. I'll pad it out with lots of seagoing lore; what is a fid, how harpoons work and how do you practice with them. 

I think a nice tragic ending is good:  Cap eaten by Pinky and maybe ship sunk, too, to be realistic and those dumb bunny sailors should have steered clear of crazy Baha in the first place.  But how will we know this old wives tale?  One survives: Mushmeal.  He is very windy guy but finally we get to end which wraps things up neatly except did he have any insurance for any heirs who possibly might pop up even though he never met them? Maybe leave reader wondering if Mush is really old sea dog willing to tell long fairy tale if you buy him a drink, story gets plenty long as long as drinks keep coming.

I'll start off this way:
"Buddy, my name is Mushmeal. If you stand me for a drink, I'll tell you a grand and epic tale that weaves together themes of obsession, revenge, and the inexorable power of nature."

 That sets the scene- you are the rapt listener (soft touch) and away we go! Now note that I'll use "TK" here and there to mean "To Come" when I don't know something, but will look it up later.  
Now, I'm writing a novel, so I need lots of pages of something and if I can't think of something to happen I will simply pad it out with any old talk that comes to mind. 

Got to fill up 250 pages.
So far we have the big fish, Capt. Baha calls him Pinky, and he is boss of whaling ship, the Lollipop, a 300 ton sloop.  Sails, not steam. It has TK masts.  I've got the beginning- leg bitten off, and the end- tragic death for all (except Mushmeal) at the hands of terrifying Pinky, or I guess fins of Pinky. 

I'll need some subplots. How about a dramatic MUTINY?  See, we've already got the mental case captain obsessed with the fish, can't just let bygones be bygones, Jeez Louise, after all Pinky was probably just a nice guy fish doing his job which is to eat things and he only ate one leg! Crew unhappy with crazy chasing after fish instead of profitable whale stabbing which might get them bonuses. They sneak around- ha! I've got it, one has a parrot that talks- hears plot and later Capt. hears parrot say"Kill Baha or put him adrift! Kill Baha or put him adrift!".  So even dimwit captain suspects something...but it's too late, Doc has musket ball pistol and has the drop on Baha- they cast out B. plus some loyal crew in a lifeboat and then maybe take ship to Pacific island paradise...Wait, I think I'll save the juicy mutiny for a future novel: "Mutiny on the Lollipop". 

Gretchen stopped by for coffee and somehow it came out that I was writing a novel, so now my secret is out and of course she said if I needed any help she might have suggestions which means here's a chance to butt in and meddle!  She's my friend, but...
 I had to tell a little about it and before I poured coffee she was off with stupid ideas like have the ship run out of coal and stall way out in the ocean, I explained it wasn't a steamboat, it had sails, wind pushed it.

Well, how about they run into a vortex, it's like a hole in the sea, and nobody knows if they even exist because if your ship gets sucked into one you're just gone and can't report about it. But Gretchen, I says, that's the end for all my characters if that happens and the fish is supposed to do that destruction so if you don't mind I'll leave the ship-swallowing hole to my fellow authors. Luckily, she had to go, Yoga lessons, so now maybe I can scratch out a few words of my novel if I can think of anything.

Got to develop more characters, the crew, for example.  I'll give them names: Doc, Happy, Sleepy, Sneezy, Bashful, Grumpy, Dopey, Jolly, Snappy, Chilly, Mumbly, Breezy, Wobbly, Giggly, Fuzzy,  Loopy , Squinty and Abraham Lincoln. Not faceless crewman no. 1, crewman no. 2, you see.  
 Abe says, "You know, Dopey, I've been studying these law books. I may run for Dingleberry Town Tax Collector."
Dopey: "What's a tax?"  
You know, these people have to live and breath! Until they die, if that's part of the story.  

Was out getting my hair done, and that's in town, picked up National Enquirer, what do you know there is article: Novel writing: Big Money! Everything you need to know!  They were talking right up my alley, to coin a phrase.  I showed it to Billy Bob, he said my dog Flapjack knows more about novels than that article. Sometimes he's just a wet blanket. "Did you ever read a book?" I says.  Sure, I read "Seven Iron Magic, by Phil somebody." 

Read some of the article. Narratives have a pattern, like stories with danger, reader might think, "Oh what's so dangerous?" So you kill off a few characters: shot with arrows right through, or squashed by boulders, or falling from the twentieth floor.  They're always MINOR characters, and they're expendable, the story goes on, sorry, but the main characters are the ones who survive.  If they fall from 12th floor there will be a convenient haystack where they land. 

You gotta handle those expendables right.  Don't spend a lot of time talking about the poor chump who is just there to be a victim of a horrible death. Crew doesn't always get along, Wobbly trips over some rope, and says what's so funny, Giggly? which leads to a fistfight, which could be an allegorical contest between good and evil or something. They stop after both suffer bloody noses. Does this mirror the struggle of the mighty ship Lollipop against the unforgiving dark sea?
 I think Giggly will be the skilled harpooner. I'll have him sitting on deck sharpening his barbed deadly weapon and telling knock-knock jokes. 

I was at the grocery to buy chocolates and ran into Doris.  How is your novel coming?  Aaagh! How did she know; Gretchen Blabbermouth, of course.  She says if it's old ships and stuff be sure to have an albatross, they are good luck, never kill one or you will die or something bad.  I says thank you Doris I know all about albatrosses lucky charm thing, plus, their wingspan can be TK feet, you know and they are members of the TK bird species, which I made up but she bought it. 

I talked to Dr. Skeleton and he was pleased at my new novel project and said that he thought  maybe the ships crew could battle some colorful pirates.

I need some more filler. After a day at sea they discover a stowaway! It's Charles Dickens who thought the ship was sailing for England and he would just hitch a ride and save the fare usually about TK. Capt. and some crew are mad at him at first, but finds out who he is and Charlie placates them by reading Chapter 5 of his new novel, Great Expectations. that's his notes, doesn't have c 1 through 4 so nobody knows story beginning, but everybody has advice about how to write; they want Pip to sign on as seaman on a whaling ship. 

It's Slimey's birthday and Snappy, Chilly, Mumbly, Breezy, and Fuzzy, have a party for him, sea biscuits with little candles, but  Capt. discovers them and he takes off his wooden leg and knocks all their hats off. That helps establish that Baha is full of anger. They play poker, five card draw, stud and spit in the ocean


Dr. S. suggests I have some 100 ft waves toss the ship around like a cork, causing cannon to break loose and maybe a couple colorful but expendable sea dogs wash overboard. Baha ship don't have no cannon, I explain.

Dr. S. has more suggestions: Make one of the crew members the young Sigmund Freud and he talks about his theories and even conducts talk therapy on other crew members and Baha himself and secretly diagnoses Capt. Baha as "One crazy puppy". Of course doesn't say that to Capt., instead explains about subconscious, ego, id, and how it could be a profitable racket, just talking to patients to make their troubles go away and charging money and maybe Baha would like to throw in with him instead of dangerous stabbing whales or pink fish. 

Surprise! Doris has some advice on my novel which I will never finish because of so many interruptions: put Edgar Allen Poe in as a bosun's mate and Poe has this myna bird he's trained to tell jokes like "Are you talkin' to me? I didn't know humans could talk!"  Also to sing "Kookaburra Sits in the Old Gum Tree". Crew laughs, but Captain Baha snarls "How can you laugh when I have my leg bitten off?" Myna bird pretends to be a woodpecker and pecks at Baha's wooden leg, Rat-tat-tat-tat! and everybody laughs except the Capt.
Doris has some coffee cake and while stuffing her face, she adds some more myna lines: "Hello, Matey, My name is Captain Baha!" and "I have a lady friend; she's a cute chick!"

Mailman came to our door with the mail. "Say, Mrs. Quibblequack, I heard you were writing a novel. About a sea voyage. I think you should put in an old sailor with a gimpy leg who is a fortune teller- uses tarot cards forecasts doom for maybe the cook or somebody and sure enough he soon washes overboard and drowns!  Well, a nice spooky note to lend atmosphere of doom, maybe he's right. Before I can say anything a neighbor's dog starts barking and he quickly runs for his van.

At the grocery store the checkout clerk says, "Are you Mrs. Quibblequark?" and she had some advice, "In your novel about WWII submarine warfare, be sure to put in the dramatic commands: Dive! Dive! Secure All Hatches and Vents! Flood Main Ballast Tanks! and some others. My grandfather used to sometimes jump up and call out these at dinnertime to amuse the kids!"  I thanked her, but explained my whaling ship didn't dive (until the end). I didn't call her a nosy busybody, but it crossed my mind.

I need to work on my novel, but my mind is a complete blank. Perhaps if I stare at the paper with pen in hand.  Perhaps if I stare at the paper with a glass of wine in my hand.

 Luckily, Doris's sister Louise somehow learned about my novel plans and efforts and they both came to visit to solve all my problems.  It will be easy Louise explained, she has a Ouija board and can connect to the vast spirit world at the drop of a hat and get advice.  But couldn't do it in living room, Billy Bob was watching an intellectual game, the Topeka Goons at Moron Stadium, I think. 

Instead we went to the kitchen. We sat around the kitchen table that BB never fixes.  Louise prepared the space to be receptive to good vibes by turning the lights down and lighting some incense. She had a warning.
"Spirits don't talk to non-believers," she said, "it creates a bad atmosphere."  She asked me if I believed in the spirit world, and I said, "Of course and Tinkerbell, too."  
So we were all set. Turns out Louise is pretty talkative, and I wondered if any spirits would get to say any of their wisdom. She explained to any and all spirits that this session would invite spirits that were friendly  and wished good things to happen to all participants, no evil spirits, please! 

Then she gave a little outline of what I had written so far on my novel, Pinky. Now she told me about the magic Ouija board: the three us would lightly place our fingers on the little pointer and ask questions out loud and then slide the thingy, which would be guided to spell out the answer by a spirit who felt like being pestered by three ditzy women.
  
"Now, Daisy, what author or expert do you want to try to contact?" 
I said, "Let's try Herman Melville."
So Louise called out "Herman Melville, Herman Melville" a few times, like you would call your dog, if its name was Herman Melville.
"If you are there, please answer 'Yes'"
Readers, please note Ouija boards have convenient "Yes" and "No" answers printed on them.

Then we paused in silence. Give the spirit a chance to put down his newspaper and pick up the phone.
"If you are there, please answer 'Yes'".
The pointer meandered, under the light touch of all of three of us.
Surprise! The pointer was gently yanked to the "Yes" spot! 
I had many questions, like what should happen after the captain loses his leg?  Sure enough, 
many answers were spelled out letter by letter. Herman recommends as follows: At first Captain Baha relentlessly pursues the great pink fish.

After a long and perilous journey across the seas, during which Baha becomes increasingly consumed by his obsession, the Lollipop finally encounters Pinky. Baha engages in a furious battle with the fish.

 Mushmeal, his faithful companion, has second thoughts. He says, Kemo Sabe, let us reflect on the events which are transpiring. He describes the vast, unknowable nature of the ocean and the fate of those who seek to conquer it, ponders the deeper philosophical and existential questions raised by Baha's quest for revenge and the relentless power of nature, and don't take it personally, that's one monster fish, would you fight King Kong, Dummy? 

So Baha says, "My arthritis IS kind of getting to me." He gets a job as captain of a Carnival Cruise ship and also works as a stand-up comedian five shows a week on the ship.  His stage name is Captain Cuckoo. Mushmeal does a juggling act juggling plastic pink fish.  Herman congratulates me and says he wishes he'd thought of that great story!

                                            This Happy Day! The Weekly Column of Joy
                                                                  by Suzy Sparkle
Oh my Dear Readers I'm excited! Today we're going to make an origami flamingo! A pink one!  Sometimes readers ask me when they write, "How do you get your exciting project ideas?"  Well, Dears, this one popped into my head as I returned home from Happy Hour at Duffy's Tavern and I happened to have several plastic pink flamingos in my yard (sooo cute with their pink feathers!  of course not real feathers 'cause they're plastic) and I thought "That's my next Suzy Project: origami flamingos!"  

Let's get started!  Here I have some delicate pink construction paper and the instructions from this little kit called "Happy Flamingo" and some Elmer's  white glue and I found those lost scissors , well, Norwood found them when he sat on the couch and was a bit grouchy about it.  Let's look at these instructions, lots of little drawings so it should be really easy, Readers.  Oh, the BLEEP, BLEEP instructions seem to all be in Chinese characters, so it's a good thing there are drawings, just use this magnifying glass.  Just fold the paper as you see in pix 1 and 2 that I've reproduced for you through the magic of printing. 
                                            ***insert drawing pix 1,2,3,4 ***
Now some of this Elmer's...to hold the flaps that will be the little wings... just pull the little thingy to open Elmer's nozzle, but it doesn't come out of the little nozzle because it's all BLEEPING dried up like it always does, BLEEP... so just unscrew the top,, that's it, and gently pour some on the paper...ARRRRG! it glopped all at once onto my grandma's Damask tablecloth! BLEEP!  Fluffy-Luv, GET OFF THE TABLE!...IT'S NOT A GAME!...YOU'RE GETTING YOUR PAWS IN THE GLUE! 

OK, a pause now, a little clean-up, and maybe a little refreshing glass of this red wine.  Here's a little Suzy Tip, buy by the CASE and save a bundle! Now we see that the Elmer's isn't sticking very well...BLEEPING stiff paper keeps springing apart! So here's what we do...  use this office stapler...CLIPPET...that'll hold it... CLUNK, OH BLEEP it's jammed... staple's stuck like it always does WHACK, WHACK, WHAM, WAP, WACK, WAP, WHAM!  OK, that won't come loose now.  
                                                       ***insert drawing pix 5,6 ***
OK. I've had a little break and a sip of Manischewitz.  Dear Readers, just keep going on the numbered instructions.  Three, four, GET DOWN, FLAPJACK! BLEEP! BLEEP! dog grabbed my flamingo, he thinks it's his squeak toy!  Knocked over my porcelain Wayne Newton from Vegas trip! BAD DOG!  Broke his little microphone off!   OK, I got it away from him.  A little crinkled, but OK.  So, see really easy. 
                                        ***insert drawing pix 7,8,9, 9 looks like a rabbit***
 Now, you can see the result in pix 9 if you folded it right, Dear Readers.  I know, you might say it looks like a rabbit, there may be a bit of translation error, but it looks good, don't you think?  That's all for this Happy Day, My Dears, I'll see you next time with another BLEEPING Suzy Project, if I can think of one!

"I've been meaning to ask you," says my pal Billy Bob, "for years you have had that photo of a chicken on your wall, why is that?  Seems to have a signature at the bottom, too."
"It's a secret, Bubba, can you keep a secret?"
Sure, he says, so I told him how come the chicken, which is not so common a photo to have, and a big one, too.
"A few years ago I was sitting on a bench in our town park, and there were a few wild geese wandering around, and they were kind of tame, really, looking for a handout.  They were often around and about, but this day there was this chicken strutting here and there, too.  Just one and what do you know she came close and hopped up beside me. 
 "Hey, my human friend, do want to make some $100?" she asked.
Of course, I looked around for the hidden speaker, it was a prank, I assumed.
However, she kept talking and I saw no signs of a trick.  
"Most people don't know this," she said in kind of a squawky voice, "Many years ago B.F.Skinner became interested in training chickens and many thought he just did some experiments with teaching dance moves and dumb stuff, but he secretly started a program of selective breeding of Rhode Island Red chickens and over the years, we got smarter and smarter, you see."  
"Talking chickens?! This sounds like one of your daffy Parish Care yarns that nobody believes!"
was Billy Bob's naive remark.
"We'll go down the street to the Bank of America ATM," she said, "and we'll get some cash out. We walked a ways, and she said, "Just pick me up and carry me, will you, I'm no spring chicken, you know."
"And I suppose she had a credit card?"
"Under her wing she had a small purse with credit cards, and I held her as she fished one out with her beak and put it in the slot. She made me close my eyes while she pecked in her PIN.  Got out $500 and gave me $100, but I said, 'Oh no, I'm happy to help.'  She further explained that the chickens progressed so well that they started to be smarter than most humans , average IQ of 150, although they call it CHI-Q."
"And a lot smarter than humans with IQ of 50 who might believe your story."
"And at first  B.F. organized truck farms for them; they worked on these farms since they could easily do planting and cultivating, being so close to the ground, they also ate a ton of pests, farm weevils and potato bugs. It wasn't long before they operated more efficiently than us humans because they were smart cookies. John Deere Company made special tractors that could be operated by chickens, you know, steering with their beaks, little pedals for their little chicken feet. What they couldn't do they hired humans to do and began to compete in the world economy."
"Billy, you ever go to a farm roadside stand and see a few chickens walking around?  Well, they are really the owners and they hire humans to take the money. I've seen their luxury chicken coops with silk nests and gourmet tortilla cookers, large-screen TV's tuned to the Home Chicken Network.
I got to be friends with Henny Penny, that's her photo on the wall, she gave me. She runs a photo processing business among others."
"I might have believed you, until you said her name was Henny Penny!"
"She's a good friend, somewhat of a worry-wart, says the sky is falling and nobody listens to her. You may have noticed at the post office those mail slots down near the floor- that's so the chickens can reach them. Remember, all this is secret. Ever wonder about those self-driving cars?  Here's how it's done: a chicken is under the hood driving, sees through the grill! There is a suspicion that Elon Musk is really a rooster in a human suit. Don't tell anybody."
 "Over the years the smart chickens learned more and more, they could type on keyboards, although they did use the hunt and peck method. Many well-known Wall Street biggies are now chicken-owned.  The mayor of Chickago is a now a chicken. Some chickens  organized a hostile takeover of Perdue, now the entire board of directors are chickens and it's now the Perdue Twinkie Company. Three chickens took over the ACME Company in a leveraged buyout, and now they make anti-coyote equipment instead of bird traps. 
Surely you've heard of the ACME Company."
"No, I never heard of them, and don't call me Shirley."
"B.F. taught them English, but they developed their own secret chicken language so they could communicate secretly, and I happen to know some, want to hear me speak Chickenese?"
"No, I don't want to hear any more nonsense."
"Squaaaw- scawah squawky-talk-talkie Puuuck-puck-puk- Squaw Bawk-Boo Squaw puuck!"
"Want to know what I said?"
"No, I don't."
I said,  "If Billy Bob does not believe me, he is a duumb cluuuck."

                                                              Library Cats

âMom, I have to write a story for school tomorrow.  Miss Beasley says we can get help to write the words but it has to be our story that we made up.â

âBilly can help you,  Iâm working on these tax returns,â said Mom.

"Kathy is only four and canât read or write yet, Billy, so you need to help her.â 

âBut Mom, I want to play baseball with Mickey outside.â

âAfter you help your little sister.â

âAwww, Mom!â  said Billy.

Billy is eight and writes and spells pretty well. 

âIâll tell you the words and you write it down for me, OK, Billy?â

âOK, OK, letâs hurry up with your stupid, boring story,  I want to go outside and play ball with Mickey.â 

âStart this way,â said Kathy,  âMiss Abigail Francis was the beautiful new librarian at the Smithville Public Library. â

Billy wrote: âAbbie Freaky was an old bag and got a new job- Slimeville Town Library.â

âDid you write the first sentence?â

âYep, I wrote it.  Now what?â

Kathy continued: âShe loved her new job and kept all the books in good order and everything was very neat and she was friendly with all the library patrons.â

Billy wrote:
âShe wore U.S. Army combat boots and smoked cigarettes and left all the books on the floor.â

Kathy continued:  âShe also loved cats and each day she would bring her cat Furball with her and Furball would sit on the counter and watch as people checked out the books.â

Billy wrote:
âThe grouchy old woman had a big bulldog who growled and scared the customers.â

Kathy said:  âMrs. Harper said it wasnât proper to have a cat in the library as it might get cat fur on the books. It was against town rules.â

Billy wrote:  âTwo big troopers came in and handcuffed Miss Freaky and slapped her in jail for violating a town ordinance.â

Kathy said:  âA patron told about her friend who was very sad, and Miss Francis said why not take Furball when you visit to cheer her up.â

Billy wrote: âThe town manager heard about the arrest and he came to the jail to fire her from the library job.â

Kathy said: âThat made the friend very happy, and so she started to loan out cats because she had several.â

Billy wrote: âGrizzly the bulldog went tearing around the library chewing up thousands of books.  The place was a shambles.â

Kathy said:  âShe loaned them out to anyone who was sad or lonely, just like library books, and had a library card for each one.  It was for two weeks at a time, unless renewed.â

Billy wrote: âThe town presented Miss Freaky with a bill for $150,000 for damages.â

Kathy said:  âThen the townspeople could see what a good thing it was and they let her have as many cats in the library as she wanted!â

Billy wrote: âMiss Freakyâs boyfriend Clyde helped her break out of jail (a felony) and they escaped in a stolen car.â

Kathy said:  âNot only that, but children loved to come to the library to pet the cats and many more came to borrow books than before.â

Billy wrote: âAbbie and Clyde took to robbing stores and soon were wanted in six states.â

Kathy said:  âMiss Francis was delighted when she was given a special award by the local school for encouraging reading!â

Billy wrote: âBoth Abbie and Clyde were arrested after a high-speed chase in Las Vegas and are now serving hard time in San Quentin Federal Prison.â

âIs it done?â asked Kathy. âThanks, Billy.â

âNo problem.â

âNow I can pass it in to Miss Beasley. Iâll bet sheâll like it.â

âIâm sure she will, Kathy, itâs not as boring as I thought.â

You will have hours of fun recreating Tom's Â® frontier adventures. Although this knife could be used to repel rabid dogs or bears, it is not to be used in personal disputes or crimes.  Do not attempt Tom's Â® "William Tell Trick", (Ref. 1), as injury could result.
13. The real (fictitious) Tom Â® enjoyed playing with explosive devices such as throwing lit firecrackers into Aunt Polly's hen house. Therefore, we have made available Accessory #5, Tom's Big Box of Firecrackers Â®.  
While amusing and fun, explosive devices may result in loss of hands, arms, legs, or heads.
CAUTION:  These are not pretend firecrackers; they have gunpowder in them, if lit they will explode. Do not hold in your hand while exploding as painful loss of fingers may result. Not to be thrown at pets or friends while exploding, especially Tom's Whopping Big Firecracker Â®, as injury, death, or ill feelings may result.
14. After many hours of riotous fun you'll have playing with Tom Â®, you may find that Tom Â® becomes a little soiled or covered with grease or slime or gobs of dirt all over him. In that case refer to Item 15. How To Clean Your Tom Sawyer Â® Doll.
15. How To Clean Your Tom Sawyer Â® Doll. There is no way to clean your Tom Sawyer Â® doll.  Perhaps you did not heed Caution 5. above; too late now.
16. CAUTION regarding Accessory #23, Tom's Crooked Poker Deck Â®. This exciting deck of cards has extra aces just like the one a riverboat gambler gave to Tom Â®.  Tom Â® had loads of fun with these amusing cards, once scamming a tidy sum from the gullible Widow Parker. However, please refrain from using these crooked cards to cheat your friends or family.  Especially avoid swindling police officers as they tend to have no sense of humor.
17. You may recall the real (fictitious) Tom Â® had a lot of fun putting live bees in friend's lunch boxes and his teacher's desk drawers.  Therefore we have made available Accessory #6, Tom's Box of Bumble Bees Â®.  These are not pretend bees, but actual live bees with stingers.  Caution: DO NOT OPEN Tom's Box of Bumble Bees Â®! To enjoy and have hours of fun, peek at the bees through the little screen door. Do not open the door as they will sting you and then die, not a happy result for either party.
18. On dark moonless nights Hannibal residents walking past the cemetery might be startled when they saw two ghostly figures moaning eerie sounds and lurching towards them.  (The furtive figures would be Tom and Huck wearing ragged white sheets.)  
You can have hours of fun re-enacting this exciting gambit by dressing Tom Â® with Accessory #15, Tom's Spooky Ghost Sheet Â®.  For most fun, visit a dark cemetery when it is windy with leaves blowing around.  Help Tom jump out at gullible passersby.  They will scream with fear and run. Ha, ha, ha. Not to be used to scare babies or dogs with sharp teeth.
Warning: If you are a timid child do not play "ghosts" with Tom Â®. If Tom Â® accidentally becomes clothed with the terrifying ghost costume and you run away screaming, remember it is just Tom Â®.  Take a deep breath and repeat aloud "It is just Tom Â®.  It is just Tom Â®."  over and over.  Also repeat "Tom Â® is alive and well."  (Well, although Tom Â® is very life-like, he is not really alive since he is an inanimate toy.)
19. Tom and Huck pretty much subscribed to the moral principle of "Finders Keeper, Losers Weepers."  So Tom happily scurried home with a box of gold coins, watch, and jewelry he found in the attic of the long-abandoned Eldridge house. Unfortunately for Tom, all the items were theater props, as he and Huck found out when they tried to buy cigars with one of the fake gold coins.
You'll have hours of fun with Accessory #11, Tom's Treasure Trove Â®. You can re-enact Tom's Â® exciting adventure, especially if there is a long-abandoned house in your neighborhood and you have burglar tools. (Make sure a house is actually abandoned before entering and looking for treasure.)
20. It won't be a surprise to you that we have made available Accessory #17,
Tom's Electric Shock Joke Â®. What fun you'll have when you offer your teachers or not-so-good friends a stick of delicious gum and when they put their greedy fingers on it- surprise! a whopper of an electric shock! Caution:
Select gullible victims who have a sense of humor or are smaller than you.
21. When pretending Tom Â® is eating something such as a dead mackerel (see Item 3 above), remember that his mouth does not actually open.  Do not attempt to modify Tom Â® with sharp instruments as damage may occur.
Frequently Asked Questions:
Q. Why does Tom Â® have a bald spot like a Franciscan Monk?
A. For best factory efficiency we used hair from our "Gabby, The Franciscan Monk" doll.
Q. Why do Tom's Â® arms and legs look like toilet paper tubes?
A. They are toilet paper tubes.
Q. My child is scared of "Spooky Tom" and cries and cries and has nightmares.
A. Tough, Lady.  Buy a Raggedy Ann.
Q. I attempted a raft adventure with Tom Â® but raft and Tom Â® sank like a rock.
A. Well, Duh!  See Item 7 above.
Q. We are having hours of fun with Tom Â®, but he has a goofy face.  Can I draw a better face on the back of his head?
A. Tom's Â® face is not goofy, but actually a subtle artistic rendering expressing the sardonic and mischievous nature of a Hannibal, MO juvenile delinquent probably headed for a life of crime.  We hope you do not create a bizarro figure with his feet pointed backwards.  Warranty void in such a case.
Q. I received my Tom Sawyer Â® doll but I can't get him to sing.  I looked everywhere for a switch. I want him to sing! sing! sing!
A. We are sorry, but Tom Â® does not sing.  Perhaps you are thinking of our "Billy Bob" Â® doll.  Billy Â® sings "Mr. Wonderful", "Rainy Day", "The Coffee Song" and other popular songs in a pleasing baritone voice.  Please see our latest catalog for details.
Q. We are having hours of fun with our Tom Â® doll.  However, our attempts to stage a minstrel show featuring Tom Â® tap dancing have failed.  Did you even ship tap dancing shoes with him?
A. Alas, there is some confusion here.  As far as we know, the real (fictional) Tom Sawyer did not tap dance, therefore we have not provided tap dancing accessories.  Is it possible you have been reading our advertisements for our "Clickety-Clack, The Tap Dancer" Â® doll?  He can be purchased from our catalog (enclosed) and would be ideal for your minstrel show.
Q. We are happy with our Tom Â® doll but did not see any shoes in with all his accessories.  Please send.
A. Oh my gosh!  We are embarrassed as we shipped thousands of Tom Â® dolls without shoes.  You know how things are sometimes, can't remember everything!  Do you happen to have some leather and cobbler's tools?  If so, you know, you could make some little shoes for Tom Â®.  Good luck.

An Eccentric Pamphlet
(A review by Prof. Elbert Handle-Bipford, PhD., Ncs., Hfd., Oxford University)
 Hidden amongst the heavier tomes I acquired at an estate sale this past Thursday at No. 67 Turnberry Cross Road was a curious and colorful pamphlet, 8 x 10 inches in size, quite shopworn. Its front cover looked like a circus poster, its title in yellow letters, âSuperman and the Ant-Menâ.    At first I thought it was a show guide for a fanciful opera, long-since sung and forgotten, but there were no singers or musical pieces listed, nor ads for hats and finery shops, no, it was in fact a bizarre form of narrative. 
My curiosity only increased as I examined each garish page.  The author may have studied ancient Egyptian wall paintings and added one more element, namely, printed words associated with each line drawing of a figure, such that the reader might surmise which figure originated those particular words.  
Not to be thrown off by this eccentricity, I read further.  As we begin, no character called âSupermanâ is in sight.  Instead we have some boring discussion amongst employees at a bank or insurance company.  Somebody named Jimmy hasnât returned from the pizza run. Where can he be?  The boss, Perry, assigns a dorky person, Clark, to go find him and says, âMake it snappy, there is work to do!â  But this shifty Clark fellow makes some lame excuse about how he canât find his glasses, so the gum-snapping office valley girl, Lois, decides to go find Jimmy.   But then it gets confusing. 
Apparently this guy Clark Kent has a twin brother, an identical twin. You canât tell one from the other from their face or body build.  But there is an important difference.  Kentâs twin is a deluded mental case who has rather grandly given himself the name âSupermanâ.  Worse, he is not presently confined to an appropriate mental institution.  You can see this could lead to trouble and you wonât be disappointed.   This same fellow, no doubt his real name is Bill Kent, or something, but we never find out, he just goes by his âSupermanâ name.  Itâs not just the name, he has this kind of close-fitting pajama outfit and wears his yellow Jockey underwear shorts on the outside.  We can guess he is embarrassed by the pajama clothes because he keeps them hidden under a pretty ordinary suit and tie.  We can guess that he is not too bright, in addition to being insane, because he thinks nobody can see him when he is in a glass phone booth, changing clothes. 
 Jimmy, we discover, did not return with the pizza for a very good reason.  He fell into a hole in a vacant lot and landed in a tunnel.  There are ant people in the tunnel who quickly capture Jimmy. Who are these ant people, anyway?  Before they inject poor Jimmy with a serum which will make him a kind of zombie who obeys all ant commands, they take the trouble to give him a little tour and a short lecture about the history of the ant people, who have some amount of pride, as we all do.  A billion-year evolutionary process in parallel with our own has resulted in the intelligent creatures we see in the drawings.  They are as large as humans, and have six legs.  Their heads have big bug eyes and they complain about poor vision.  Some of them have reading glasses with hundreds of lenses.  They walk on two legs and use the other four for reading newspapers, playing cards, and other stuff.  Looks like they can shuffle two decks at once. Funny thing is, they talk perfect English, but with a kind of staticky stutter.  They carefully explain to Jimmy their plan to soon inject everybody who goes through the subway turnstiles, thus netting large numbers of zombies per day.
Meanwhile, we see what Clark Kentâs brother is up to.  Heâs got on his Superman suit and now we enter his delusionary mind:  the poor schlemiel is a real whacko,  he thinks heâs leaped into the sky, and keeps going, gravity doesnât count with this guy!  His eyes become flashlights and illuminate objects not normally visible.  Apparently, he heard about Jimmy being missing and is looking for him, too (In his mind).
Kentâs brother talks to himself, too.  As the delusions proceed, he mutters that there is too much LEAD ORE in the earth around the city of Metropolis and he doesnât like it one bit! 
Look!  Theyâve let Jimmy go!  He returns to the jubilant co-workers, however, somethingâs not right.  He tries to convince everybody to take subway rides.  He wonât stop talking about the subway, and quits his job, and gets a job with the subway authority in their advertising department. 
Now we see Clark pondering; he passes a movie theater.  Thereâs a zombie movie playingâ¦   this apparently makes him think of a light bulb.   He goes to find Jimmy and makes him sneeze with some sneezing powder, explaining, âJust a joke, Jimmy, ha, ha, ha!â  Rudely grabbing Jimmyâs hanky, he now has a sample of Jimmyâs saliva.  Are you still with me? 
Now it gets muddy.  I guess Clark and Bill talk often, because we see not Clark Kent, but Superman studying the saliva in a well equipped science lab!  Superman doesnât seem to have a job, where does he get the money for the fancy lab?  The saliva is analyzed.  Poor Jimmy is loaded with the same devious chemical compound that ants use to control their aphid slaves!  Now we are cooking.
Now Superman has another flying delusion about visiting an earthquake detection center and getting them to home in on any sounds of the same frequency that ants are known to communicate with.
More likely he just called on the phone.  These earthquake guys work fast;  we soon see a map pinpointing a source of tell-tale vibrations.  Surprise! Itâs that vacant lot in Metropolis! 
Now another really wild delusion! Superman not only leaps into the sky with a perfect 10-mile trajectory, landing exactly  on the antsâ tunnel entrance, but he tears big gaping holes in the ground, exposing the varmints.  They fight back with weapons that look a lot like crossbows.  Army units have been called and all the thousand or so ant people are captured.
Dramatic, but we know they just called the army guys.
Youâll be glad to know that it was possible to counteract the zombie serum.  Jimmy takes that medicine and a lot of strong coffee and is soon back at the same dreary office with the others, laughing and playing tricks like putting Clarkâs carbon paper in backwards when heâs not looking and hiding his glasses. 
Now letâs think about what our author is really up to.  One might think this story is an entertaining tale of a challenge by a menacing force and its eventual defeat.  But we ask,  is the real goal to probe the readerâs psyche?  Is the real goal to peel away surface fraud that encrusts each and every one of us?  No, itâs just another stupid story.

Letter From Camp

Just a "Hello"          from your camper,
it's still raining;        getting damper.
Sorry for the             soggy letter.
A big bear ripped up our tent and made it wetter.

To scare bears off      they say noise will,
we did show that        screaming boys will.
Didn't get me              or Bob Dempsey,
but they found the camp refrigerator empty.

I had fun with            Johnny Patches,
In a game of              Slingshot Matches.
There's a trick that   I'm still learning,
to shoot quickly        while it's burning.                 
But a problem           sometimes happens,
you might get a little bill for burned-down cabins.

It's fun helping           all the camp guys,
using small saws        or the big size.             
Just use power            don't be queasy,
cutting tall trees         is so easy.
We cut twenty             part of Earth Day,
so please get me a gas chainsaw for my birthday.

Have you heard of      an old camp song,
"Hello Momma"         maybe that's wrong,
"Hello Daddah"          something like that,
silly rhyming               jokes that fall flat.
Dad, of course you     would not be one,
to make fun of            your poor young son.
If it happened             to be funny,
I guess it could           bring in some money.
Please respect our      family loyalties.
If you do write songs I think I should get royalties.

By Lake Erie               we were wading,
the camp crew was    excavating,
What a cool guy          Mr. Crozer,
he let us drive             his bulldozer.
A small lever               was marked "Forward",
I went backward         which was shore-ward.
It was just a                little blunder,
I jumped out but Mr. Crozer's rig went under.

A warped arrow           will not fly straight,
you may find out          when it's too late.
It may go lower,           it may go higher,
causing damage             to transpire.
Stained glass windows   though they look 
                                         strong,
struck with arrows        they don't last long.
Please remember           before blaming,
these things don't always go where one is aiming.

Me and Sharkey         and Ben Tyding,
saddled up for            horseback riding.
There was bad news  and the source is,
Camp G. didn't           own the horses.
Angry farmers            in due course meant,
they would call in       law enforcement.
I don't mean to           cause excitement,
but it could mean       three indictments.
The camp lawyer        Mr. Kiners,
says the jail time might be short because we're minors.

We got sparklers        from Ms. Trackers,
And some giant          firecrackers.
Until now I                 had no notion,
how to make a           big explosion.
It was easy                 using science,
just put bullets in a microwave appliance.

We got haircuts         from John Tunney.
My new Mohawk's    kind of funny.
I have presents          though not many,
not forgetting            sister Penny.
She will laugh when        I surprise her,
it's a little                        box of spiders.
We played card games    with Coach Roker,
and I lost a thousand dollars playing poker.


We watched workers    take a stump out.
Dynamite sure               made it jump out.
It threw dirt up             and big rocks, too,
just don't let them         come down on you.
They were good to        me and Andy,
we got ten sticks each and they will come in handy.

We are learning         native culture,
tomahawks and        totem sculpture.
I learned how to        throw a hatchet.
It is fun to                  try to catch it. 
We did art with          Mr. Kimble,
pictograms and          native symbols.
foxes, snakes and      giant beetles.
We all got a chance to use the tattoo needles.  

Sorry for the           motor boat loss,
Benny Parker         saw it float off.
I did use a               rope and knot it,
(possibly I               just forgot it),
It won't go too        far in theory,
that Chris Craft is surely somewhere on Lake Erie.

Not much news here    so I'll end now.
Any cookies                 you can send now?
Don't let bad news       be a damper,
please plan four weeks next year for your happy camper.

Just one thing, Dad,     I was thinking,
you like singing           when you're drinking.
You show lots of         flare for music,
you've got talent         why not use it?
If it means a                shot at glory,
just between us, I could fabricate some stories.

AP Wire Service June 19, 2021
Testimony was heard today in Metropolis City Small Claims Court pertaining to a property damage suit against Clark Kent, age 118, a long-time reporter for The Daily Planet.  According to the plaintiff, Dr. L. Luthor, Mr. Kent became agitated upon learning that the multi-vitamins the doctor had prescribed contained one percent kryptonite, whereupon Mr. Kent smashed his fist through the brick wall in the doctor's office.
âI was surprised and frightened by Mr. Kent's actions.â said Dr. Luthor.  In further testimony, he described how Mr. Kent picked up his heavy mahogany desk and sent it crashing through his office window to the courtyard below.
âUp until now I have always considered Mr. Kent to be mild-mannered.â said Dr. Luthor.  âI knew he was in good health for his age, â he added, âbut he is much stronger than most of my patients.  He also stomped out of my office to the parking lot and picked up my BMW sedan and slammed it upside down in a ditch!â
The defendant, Mr. Kent, said that he may have over-reacted, but asked that the court magistrate take his advanced age into account and also the fact that he was allergic to kryptonite. 
During the proceedings it came to light that Mr. Kent had declined to have his fingerprints taken, which was considered a contempt of court infraction and led to a quick finding for the plaintiff. The total damages of $73,245 will be paid to Dr. Luthor at the rate of $19 per month, attached from Mr. Kent's $44 per month wages, until paid in full.

Fact checking note: AP Wire Service cannot vouch for the accuracy of the reference to kryptonite.  Krypton is an inert gas. Under extreme conditions krypton reacts with fluorine to form the gas KrF2, but quickly dissociates into unbound atoms.

Another report from Metro News' Our World, October 22, 2021:
Today I continued my "Man in the Street" interviews, this time in Topeka, Kansas.  I approached a down-and-out fellow lolling on a dusty curb clutching a paper bag in the shape of a bottle.
"Sir, you look familiar.  Were you in a 1930's movie about a tornado?"
"Get lost, lady!"
"My Gosh, are you that fellow with the funnel hat-  the Tin Man?"
"That bum gig!  Don't remind me... I got rusty in the rain and sore feet from walking on those hot yellow bricks... and all I got was union scale!"
"Wow! You're famous, Mr. Tin Man!"
"Bah!  Take after take in the hot sun- ever touch tin in the hot sun, girly?  $#@&^% wind machine blew sand into my joints!"
"But Sir, that movie was a classic."
"Yah, yah, &*^%$%$#  Cowardly Lion mugged it up...tried to upstage me every scene!"
"But did it lead to a movie career?"
"Hah! the studios stereotyped me, you know.  No leading man offers.  Almost got a sidekick role with Roy Rogers, but that Gabby Hayes waddled onto the set with his bushy beard and talking through his nose just to get attention."
The aging trouper paused to take a swig from his paper bag, and then continued.
"I did read for the lead in 'Sunset Boulevard' but they realized I couldn't float in the opening pool scene, so no dice there.  My old Hollywood pal, The Michelin Tire Man tried to teach me to swim...'course he bobbed around like a cork, I went straight to the bottom.
Say Missy, you got a couple bucks you can spare?  I'm thirsty, all this talkin' does make a body thirsty."
"Well, I guess so, Mr. Tin Man."
"You know, I couldn't get no parts.  Did a lousy Pennzoil commercial.  Auditioned for 'Star Wars', but that @#^%$&^  C3PO beat me out with his cheap flashy gold look and fake British accent!
They didn't let me do my tap dance routine in that Oz B movie- don't need no taps in my shoes, got steel feet!  I'll show ya!"
"Mr. Tin Man, be careful, you're older now!"
I took his metal hand, rusty with age, and helped him to his feet.  He did some dance steps, but his stovepipe legs wobbled and he suddenly collapsed in a clanking heap!
"Oh, I hope you're OK."
"Well, I haven't practiced for awhile.  Got a few dents...^%$#%$^& curbstones are hard!  Say, listen, you got a few bucks for some Bondo body filler to fix these dents?

Overheard at the Department of Motor Vehicles:
"Mr. Wayne, I see that you've requested the vanity plate name "BATMOBILE" .  I'm sorry, but that has too many letters.  What other name would you like?"
"Well, actually it's for my friend's car.  How about 'BATCAR'?  Not really the best, but...."
"No, I'm sorry but that's taken by another person, a Mr. T. Joker."
"Whaaaaat??!! It can't be... that miserable cur!... I mean...my friend is going to be very disappointed.  How about 'BATONE'?"
"Sorry, but that's been assigned to Mortimer Penguin of this city."
"Holy Moly!?!   I can't believe it!!"
"Mr. Wayne, I could give you 'BATTY', how about that?"
"No, no, no...."
"Well, we could do 'BATZY',   or 'BATBOY' "
"No, no, no....are you crazy?"
"Sir, there are people waiting in line.  I see on your application you haven't specified the make and model of your vehicle.  You need to fill those in."
"Well, I didn't know what to put there...I hate forms.  I guess the model is 'Batmobile' and it was made by ACME Company."
"Sir, ACME is not on our list of recognized automobile manufacturers, so you will have to register it as an Experimental Vehicle, and we will have to put the letters 'XV' on your plate."
"No, that's terrible, it messes up my name... I mean my friend's name."
"Sir, we'll also need the vehicle serial number."
"Serial number?   #@$%^^%  !  I'll have to call Robin, I mean my friend, to find the #@$%^^%  serial number, if there even is one!  Is there a pay phone around here?"
"No, they took it out. Everybody's got a cell phone now."
"Cell phone!   What's a cell phone?"
"It's a phone you carry with you."
"But where do you plug it in?"
"Don't need to, it's wireless."
"Really?  I'll have to tell my friend about that!" 
"One more thing, Sir.  I see your vehicle's model year is 1939.  That means it has to be registered as an antique and have the letter 'A' as a prefix on the plate.  So that leaves room for only three more letters or numbers."
"Whaaaat! This is unbelievable, this is why people hate the DMV!"
"Also, Sir, I see you are applying for a charitable non-profit discount..."
"Yes, you see I'm... my friend is a crime fighter and performs a valuable public service at no charge."
"Oh, you mean he is a bounty hunter, like Dog, The Bounty Hunter?"
"No, no,  he does work with law enforcement to catch criminals, but never charges a fee."
"So he works with law enforcement?"
"Yes, the police commissioner often requests his help."
"Really?....say, Mr.....ah..Mr. Wayne, you know last week I got a ticket for speeding and I have to go to court, but I was only just slightly speeding..."
"Uh huh,  well listen, what did you say your name was again?"
"It's John."
"Well, John, I always say, 'You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours'.   That court appearance might disappear if I get that 'BATMOBILE' plate with no #@$%^^%  'AXV' letters attached!"
"Shhhh!....Not so loud, Mr. Wayne.   (whisper)  OK, you got it.  'BATMOBILE' it is, and forget about that serial number!"

Transcript, audio recording left on after a show in 1955
"Whew, I'm glad those Peanut Gallery kids are gone...they can't sing worth a darn.  Hey, Clarabell, that's a wrap.  Let's get outta here and have a drink at Winky's bar across the street!"
"Honk, Honk."
"Buffalo Bob..."
"Yes, Howdy?"
"Buffalo Bob, I'd like to go to Winky's, too, you know.  I don't like to complain but every day at 6:00 PM it gets real quiet... we're all having fun and singing and dancing and laughing and then every day after the show I don't have any fun.  Just stay all kind of slumped in a corner until the next show."
"Howdy, remember how I explained to you how you're a puppet and that has some limitations- can't always sing and dance?"
"Buffalo Bob, that joke you told today about me trying to get a staring role in the western movie 'High Noon'...you said 'not unless somebody pulled strings for him!' and everybody laughed, but I don't get the joke."
"Well, Howdy, I was referring to your strings."
"What strings, Buffalo Bob?"
"Howdy, you know you are a real star- you can sing, dance and act and the kids love how animated and lively you are and here's the thing:  it's the strings that animate you."
"But Buffalo Bob, I know I'm not grown up yet, but I'm a big boy, a big rootin' tootin' cowboy- don't need no strings!"
"Howdy, let's talk some more tomorrow- got a big show tomorrow, Princess Summerfall Winterspring is coming..."
"I'm a real boy, Buffalo Bob."
"No, you're a puppet, Kiddo, and good thing, you know, if you were a real boy NBC would have to pay you union scale and this is a low budget show and you probably wouldn't have this job!" 
"Sure I ACT like a puppet, but that's my shtick, Buffalo Bob."
"Howdy, ever wonder why your voice sounds a lot like mine?  Do you remember that time I got the hiccups and you got the hiccups at the same time.  I couldn't shake them until Clarabell squirted me in the face with his seltzer water."
"Buffalo Bob, I don't like to talk about strings.  I don't like to complain, but you know real cowboys have Stetson hats, that's what I should have. They're made in Texas, Buffalo Bob.  Do you have a Stetson, Buffalo Bob?"
"Well, yes I do...."
"Well, see, there you go!  I should have a Stetson, too."
"But Howdy, remember, you asked about this before and Stetson didn't have one your size which is 1-1/2,  remember?  No size 1-1/2."
"Well, even more important, I've got my cowboy outfit, but I can't be a real cowboy without a HORSE.  Can you get me a real horse, Buffalo Bob?  Maybe a miniature horse until I grow bigger."
"A horse?  Horses cost a lot of money, Howdy...."
"And I'd need some spurs.  I need spurs so I can kick the horse to make him go fast."
"Howdy, that would be mean to kick the poor horse!"
"Well, he'd better go fast, if he didn't, it would be 'No more Mr. Nice Guy' then!"
"Do you mean 'No more Mr. Nice Puppet'?  We can't afford a horse, Howdy, this is a low budget show."
"Another thing, I really need to get rid of these freckles.  I've got 48 of them, one for each state!  That's too many.  I never liked them anyway. How can I get rid of them?"
"Well, I suppose some paint remover would do it, but you need them, it's part of your nerdy appeal."
"Paint remover!  No, no, I have tender skin, Buffalo Bob."
"Howdy, I explained, you're a wooden puppet, you've got enamel, not skin."
"Buffalo Bob, I've been reading about the old Wild West shows and Annie Oakley.  She was a sharpshooter.  She could shoot coins.  Throw up a silver dollar and she would shoot it out of the sky!  I could be a sharpshooter on the show!
"Howdy, we can't do that!"
"I've got my six-gun, but I need bullets-  can you get me .11 caliber bullets?  Get .11 longs, they've got more power! And how about this-  I could shoot from horseback like Annie did.  I would ride into the studio on my horse and shoot an apple that Clarabell throws up, the kids would love that and...."
"Howdy, Howdy, you're talking crazy! We can't shoot guns in the studio!"
"Honk, honk."
"What is it, Clarabell?   Oh, I see. We still need to do that Rice Krispies spiel. I hate that mushy cereal- Crackle and Pop- what a joke!"
"Here's the box, Howdy, and don't knock over the box this time!   And then it's Winky Drinky time across the street! Clarabell, do you have to wear your clown suit to Winky's?"
"Wait, Buffalo Bob, I want to go, too."
"But Howdy, it's not possible, besides, you're too young to go to a bar. Bye, now."
"Buffalo Bob....
Buffalo Bob....
Buffalo Bob...."
"Oh, all right, Howdy, C'mon along.  But you can't have a beer, you're too young."

This Happy Day! the Weekly Column of Joy
by Suzy Sparkle
Oh my Dear Readers I'm excited!  It is Fall and I found these stunning colored leaves! Look at this one- a gorgeous yellow, not just yellow but a golden yellow yellow with maybe some canary, or lemon around the edges. I did not have to go far, they are all around my neighborhood.  Let's look together for some more... Oh, won't you be my neighbor?   Or NEI-EI-EIGH-BOR, as my horse, Cream Puff, would say!  "Won't you be my neighbor?" I think I'll write a little song about that- but later, later.... see this yellow beech leaf?  By the magic of the printing press, courtesy of Mr. Gutenberg, (did he do color?) here it is now!  
                                            ***insert drawing of oak leaf*** 
For today's Suzy column we're going to do something special- preserve this leaf using WAX PAPER.  This is really easy to do using an ordinary ironing iron like this one I have OW!  OW!- don't touch that part- you probably have one of these and you may have an ironing board, and I have one, too, but I don't know where it is right now so I'll just put this dish towel on my bureau and here we go.  
Put the leaf between the wax paper and gently iron- see, the leaf gets flat- wait a minute- it's turning brown!  Bleep!  the bleeping iron is too bleeping hot!- let's lift it up OW!  OW!  OW!- touched the bleeping bleep iron   OH NO! BLEEEP!! the iron melted the varnish and my good dish towel with Elvis on it is stuck to my grandmother's antique bureau she brought over from the old country and lied about its value to the customs inspector!  Oh, no she didn't- that's just a story she used to tell!
Time to sit down and take a deep breath.  Here I have other leaves- here's a bright red one- hah, we're not done yet- got plenty of leaves, the bleeping trees dump them all over our yard!  And my bleeping lazy bleep husband, Norwood, never rakes them! Oh my!- yes, here's a beautiful crimson one- Oh Readers, let's iron this one- an oak or maple or butterscotch this time and... Oh, I see I have to go now.  Stop by next week for "This Happy Day"!  We'll be knitting some baby booties or some bleeping thing!

AP News: NYC

A man dressed in a tight-fitting Spandex blue suit with red cape and red boots was arrested today and charged with running on foot 90 miles per hour down the JFK Expressway.  The high-speed pursuit using flashing lights and sirens ended near 42nd Street when NYC Police cruisers caught up with him and pulled him over.  The colorful gentleman, who gave his name as Sue Perman, stated that he had to run fast to catch the penguin he was pursuing.  

Sgt. Joe Friday, speaking to reporters of the incident, was skeptical.  âWe just want the facts, and the fact is there are no penguins around here except maybe in the Bronx Zoo.  I asked Mr. Perman if he perhaps was chasing pigeons, as New York has them in abundance, however Mr. Perman remarked that was not the case and added that he hated pigeons because they got in his way when he was flying. When asked for identification, he said he did not have a driver's license or social security card because he was not born on Earth, but on the planet Krypton. I will make no judgments about this gentleman's sanity, but we are checking local mental health facilities to determine if there are any missing patients.â 

Amidst the beeping horns and traffic snarl Mr. Perman protested that there was no New York State or municipal law restricting the speed of runners, and this caused considerable hesitation on the part of the police officers, who discussed the matter, and  thought a charge of jaywalking might apply.  

Traffic was at a standstill because of the police cruisers and many New Yorkers gathered to observe the brightly clothed man being taken into custody.  A large city bus was parked at an awkward angle, blocking one lane and its driver was somewhat angry.  We interviewed the driver, a Mr. Ralph Kramden who said, âThat guy ran right in front of me, weaving in and out of traffic.  He's a nut case!  Get him off the road!â  

These remarks were overheard by Mr. Perman and he left the scene without being charged after all.  He was somewhat miffed as evidenced by his parting remarks calling Mr. Kramden âTubbyâ and telling Sgt. Friday to âLose the 1940's fedora, Flatfoot!â.

Fact-checking note:  Penguins are not native to New York City.  They can walk on land, but only about two miles per hour.  In water they can swim up to 5.6 miles per hour.

From the diary of Margaret Mitchell's little-known envious sister, Lulubel:
Dear Diary,
I will either string together this cute bead necklace kit (on sale at Kresge's, 79 cents) or write that novel I've been planning.  Let's take a look at these pretty beads.  Need scissors for this package....but you know,  I've been looking for those scissors and can't find them....I'll just rip this package, how hard can it be.. OH BLEEP! I split it open and all the beads went everywhere!  
Ok, relax now.  OK, the novel is a better idea.  Here goes:
Tex, whose real name was Pembrook Pamby, crouched by the smoldering campfire and used his forefinger to push up his new Stetson which cost $49.95 at the Tombstone General Store, the one on Tumbleweed Street, but it stuck on his sweaty forehead and he pushed too far and his new Stetson flopped into the smoldering ashes of the outlaw's campfire and he tottered on his new high-heeled boots, losing his balance and toppling into the still hot fire before he could explain what he learned from the campfire about the escaping outlaws, losing some trail cred in the onlooking eyes of the Pinkerton men who had hired him.
NAW!  Let's start again. 
Angelina dreamed of being a a famous opera singer!  Yes, yes, yes, she repeated to herself. I WILL appear as a headliner at the famed opera house in Vienna and around the world!  I know I will have to practice every day for hours, but I will, I will! No silly games like my lazy friends.  And I know I'm only a little fish in a big pond, but that won't stop me!  Unfortunately, things were worse than she thought, because Angelina was indeed a little fish, a goldfish swimming in a pretty small goldfish bowl and could not sing except for a little gurgling sound that the other goldfish couldn't hear, even if they had ears. 
NAH!  Maybe time for a refreshing glass of wine about now, unless I finished it this morning...Ah, here it is.
Let's start that novel again, Diary:
Casey glared at the opposing pitcher as he applied some more pine tar to the handle of his trusty bat, Buster.  He pawed at the dirt with his cleats so his feet would not slip.
His body was a tightly wound spring as the lanky pitcher hurled a blazing fastball that caught the low edge of the hitting zone and it went SMACK into the catcher's glove before Casey could swing.  He swore under his breath and dug in, ready this time. "Start your swing when the ball leaves his hand.  Start your swing when the ball leaves his hand." he repeated to himself the cardinal rule of hitting.  Here's the ball... SMACK! into the catcher's glove. Now Casey was getting mad,  he stepped out of the batter's box and adjusted his calfskin batting gloves and pushed his helmet tight to his head and thumped the plate with his bat and stared at the mound with a terrible glower.  The windup...and a 100 mile per hour pitch came right down the middle as Casey stood frozen! "Strike three, yer out!" yelled the umpire. Casey thought, "Maybe the fix is NOT in."
NAW!  Where are those beads?, let's pick up these beautiful beads and look at the instructions and maybe pour a bit more wine, Diary, what do you say?

What's in the mail today? Here's something from Friends of the Ocean.  "Dear Supporter, We are glad to tell you that the Grumpy Carp is no longer endangered, in fact has multiplied in record numbers, so we have discontinued our recent emergency campaign and we are returning the money you contributed, with interest from last July.  Thanks again. 
Also, no whales have beached themselves at all, anywhere, so our entire beach rescue crew is being laid off and offered the option to be retrained as street jugglers or mimes or something.  Cordially, Wilton Smathers,  President"
Interesting.  Here's one from The American Heart Advisory Committee:  "Dear Contributor:   Please do not send any contributions to our nationwide Anti-Twinkie Initiative.  We have discovered that a high-Twinkie diet is beneficial, and now also recommend those fluffy marshmallow cupcakes sold under the brand name 'Sugar Bombs' ."
Wait, am I reading this right?  There is more.  Here's a heavy package from The Franklin Mint.  What's in it?  My Gosh, coins!  "Dear Sir or Madam:  We are pleased to send you 100 solid gold coins stamped with the likeness of the King himself, Elvis!  Our company owner, Snidley Fringleham II, since he has 88 billion dollars, not counting the two countries he owns, has decided to give back so he is sending coins to some peasants like you. Please ignore our previous ads for coins which really were way overpriced, let's face it."
Let's pause here to catch my breath.  
"Dear Billy Bob,  Thank you for your recent purchase of the Rolex watch ($9.99 plus tax) from the home shopping network Home Shopping Network.  Due to certain communications with the U. S. Federal Trade Commission, regarding trademarks, we would like to ask you to please apply the enclosed little sticker with the word "Rotex" directly over the word "Rolex" on the watch you recently purchased.  Be sure to completely cover the word "Rolex".  On a further note, your subscription to "Hollywood Gossip" magazine has been delayed due to last-minute libel considerations. 
Next on the mail pile:  An envelope marked "IMPORTANT".  Naturally, I hasten to rip it open.  "Dear Mr. Bob, We received your contribution to our "Sweaters For Squirrels" campaign, however, we are returning it because further study has revealed that squirrels have plenty of fat and fur to keep warm after all. Further, I am eliminating my own job and closing the doors on our penthouse headquarters.  Sincerely,  Palmer "Biffy" Featherstone.  
What's this? Something else from The Philadelphia Mint.  "Dear Sir or Madam,  There has been an unfortunate mistake.  Mr.  Fringleham II has consulted with his tax attorneys and it seems that the gold coin giveaway will not result in tax reduction after all!  So please send back the gold coins he so generously sent to you.  Your prompt attention to this matter is appreciated.  Sincerely, Fungus Parmelton, Esq.
I put this letter in the recycling bin, it's good to recycle, you know. 
Let's continue with the mail.  Next is an envelope decorated with pine trees.
"Dear Adopt-A-Tree Patron:
It turns out that TREES are causing global warming and subsequent expected disastrous flooding, too much CO2, and something about ozone, too. (See National Enquirer 12/3/22, p.3).  Naturally, this news has caused some changes in our organizational policy.  We have cut down all 75 million acres of trees in our Adopt-A-Tree worldwide program, including your particular adopted tree which you named "Old Hickory" even though it was a hemlock. Proceeds from tree sales will go to the purchase of gigantic machinery for slash cutting evil trees in the Amazon Rain Forest.  Sincerely, Clendon Butterball, Chairman"
What's this?  A package.  "Your gift from The Postal Worker's Pension Fund" it says on the outside.  It's a DVD.  It's  the movie "The Postman Always Rings Twice". Yeah, I know it, a 1946 film noir.  
RING!  RING! 
I roll over in bed, groggy, and wake up from my dream.  I pull on my bathrobe and answer the door. The mailman hands me the real mail.  On top is a fuel oil bill for $756.67.

From McGrew-Hall Elementary School "Our World" Series by permission.
"One Tire's Life"
Let me tell you how it is with a tire.  My name is Charlie Tire and I have rolled many miles over the hills and valleys of this old earth.  Let's start at the Beginning: I was born in the GungHo-Min Factory  in Pang  Province, China.  It was the night shift and the weather was hot and the huge vulcanizing press was hotter as I popped out.  The first words I heard was Chin-Saou saying, "A bad one, Chummy, warped treads, let's dump this one!"  "Naw, said Chummy, "just wrap that loser up quick, before anybody sees!" I have been forever grateful, Chummy!  My birth name was GM-8,60 X4, but I later took the more friendly name Charlie.  I soon joined a multitude of my tire brethren as we were unceremoniously loaded into a shipping container and hence aboard a container-ship.  The accommodations were somewhat crowded and I complained along with my new pals.  "We're packed in here like sardines!" said Skippy. Well, when you are a very young tire, you don't know much about the world and I don't think he knew what sardines were and neither did I.  There was a strong smell of rubber and Danny speculated that we were all rubber basketballs and we talked about not wanting to be bounced around being dribbled and then dunked into a hoop.  What if some dumb kid over inflates us?  We worried about that. You know they poke a NEEDLE into you to put the air in, that's gotta hurt!" moaned Benny.  
 They slammed our container around during unloading and we bounced around like we were made of rubber which we were, but after another bumpy ride things got quiet. I was unwrapped and breathed in some cool, fresh air.  Well, it wasn't so cool as I was in this little garage in Punktown, AZ, daytime temp of 100 degrees F, but I didn't know about F temp scale, being a young tire. Some other tires were there, just hanging around and they all were older and they had learned a few things from listening to people talk and they passed on some to me. I learned that I wasn't a basketball, but a tire and likely my job in life would be rolling over roads attached to a car or maybe a truck. I made friends with Hank and Mildred and Jesse, but before long Bucky, the garage owner, sold my pals to customers and off they rolled.  Pretty boring for awhile but one day this young squirt of a kid with a cowboy hat came swaggering  in and he needed a tire and asked Bucky for the cheapest one he had and Bucky rolled me over off the rack to be inspected. "Got warped treads there, Gramps!" says the kid.  I didn't like him right away, and thought "Don't sell me to this punk kid, Bucky!" but he did and for a discount, too, wouldn't you know!
Well, Bucky pops me onto the tire machine and blasts me with 90 psi OOWW! to set my rubber rims to the steel rims.  Rolls me outside and I could see right away the kid's got this gawd-awful old junker of a jalopy, even though I am just a young tire I could see that. I was put on the left rear on his rear wheel drive crate. SCREEEEEEECH!  That's the sound of us rear tires as he peeled away down the road. It made me kind of dizzy being spun at a few hundred rpm, but I got used to it, and at least there was something to see besides the back corner of Bucky's garage.  Well, this fellow had some name I don't remember, but I called him "Punk", and he was pretty reckless and sometimes I was sure we were headed over the edge into a canyon and sure enough one day his girl friend was riding with him and he went around a corner too fast, showing off, and hit the ditch and the car ended up on its right side!  I was therefore dangling up in the air, still spinning for awhile, same as Sammy, the left front tire.  Girl friend was mad as they climbed out, "My Daddy was right about you, a reckless no-good, I hate you, Fenton!" she said. That was his name, Fenton.  Way to go, girl, I thought, dump him for good. The car was crinkled up a lot beyond what it already was and got sold for junk and the junk-man, Prescott, took us tires and we sat around his junkyard and time seemed to stand still.  Sammy, Cliff, Helen and I just hung around.  We got to playing a game of imaginary poker, didn't have cards, we just  thought of the cards being dealt.  Fun, but Sammy won a lot, maybe wasn't entirely an honest tire, you think? One day Prescott has some black paint and paints all us tires so to look new, not scuffed and used and before we knew it we were put in a new tire store in Chicago. A fellow in a gray fedora came in the next day, in a hurry, needed four tires and we were them. We get put on his 12 cylinder Lincoln Continental and Helen, our pal tire who has been around tells us,"That's Dillinger that owns this car, John Dillinger who knocks over banks all the time! Well, you could suspect he was packing heat the way his suit-jacket bulged right out.  He spent a lot of time driving in the middle of the night and parking in alleys near banks, maybe he was casing, you think? Then this day he parks right in front of The First National Bank of Evanston and leaves the engine running.  "I smell trouble," says Helen. Five minutes later out comes Dillinger, his hat flying off his head and we speed off, weaving in and out of traffic.  "Listen," says Sammy, "you all deflate some air!" he says to us tires.  Tires can do that, just lift a gap off the rim and leak air, we sometimes do that just for a joke.  A siren we could hear behind us. We leaked air and it wasn't long before we went flat and the big car was slowed right down and stopped and the hapless robber ran for it, but was slowed by carrying a suitcase full of money and the cops nabbed him.  "Did you buy cheap tires, John?" the cops taunted him. Did us four tires get any credit? No. His car was sold and the snobby new owner replaced us with whitewalls, so once again I had no home until the big circus came to town and needed tires for their clown car.  I was right front and it was a pretty good gig.  See, I'll tell you a little secret how they get so many big clowns in that little car. They got a trap door.  They drive the car in and park right over the trap door.  Then all those clowns come out that were hiding under the trap door!  Good part is we get applause, which is good, even if you are just a tire. Bad part is the circus has a long off season and the clown car just sits in the smelly animal barn for months.  Fact is I had many other owners after that before I finally ended up in The Museum of the Twentieth Century where I am now on display, old and somewhat bald, so you all can know about tires before all cars and trucks began using anti-gravity floating to get around.

Air Travel Made Easy
Airplanes are big buses made of aluminum foil that go up into the sky really high. What holds the plane up? Wings. There are two types of wings- fixed and flapping. Fixed wings were developed by the Wright brothers and flapping wings were developed by the Wrong brothers. Jazz age fliers favored the flapping wing planes, and got the nickname "flappers". The jouncy ride made serving drinks difficult and these days you seldom see a flapping wing plane. Wings have a special shape and because of the air flow pressure difference or something they hold the plane up, but if you stop in the sky, all bets are off and the invisible force called "gravity" will cause the whole shebang to drop like a rock, but let's not talk about that. 
At the front end is the highly trained pilot who has gotten the job by passing a test with questions like "What is an airplane?". Your highly trained pilot will not stop in the sky, so don't worry.  Unless, of course, a blundering idiot pilot turns the engines off by mistake while reaching for coffee, or the fuel runs out, or the engines explode.  But then of course everyone can use their parachutes to float down slowly... oops...actually there aren't any parachutes, so don't count on that.  Instead, it is recommended that you place your food tray in the upright position and secure it with the little thingy.  For your air travel you may have a choice of seats: aisle, center, or window.  Here are some tips: 
1. Never pick the aisle seat because you will be bumped by people carrying giant suitcases and passing serving carts causing you to spill your drink and the pilot will constantly advise everyone to see the once-in-a-lifetime sight out the window which you can't see at all because center person and window person are sticking their fat heads in the way. 
2. Never pick the center seat because you will be constantly getting up to let the window seat person get by and invariably the aisle person and the window person, who have never met before in their lives will start blabbing to each other about every boring detail of their empty, meaningless lives and exchanging names, addresses, and phone numbers and reaching across in front of you and your book to show off their cheap rings or palm read their fortunes. 
3. Never pick the window seat as the sun will be very bright in your eyes and you will have to climb over two people to get in or out and you will have to go the bathroom as soon as you sit down and aisle person and center person will scowl at you for requesting eight or nine measly drinks as though you were a lush. 
After boarding to start your exciting air journey your flight attendant will ask you to buckle your seat belt. The seat belt will hold you in place in case of a crash or severe air turbulence. If the plane turns upside down, instead of cracking your head on the ceiling you will be held helplessly upside down attached to your seat. If any of these happen, place your food tray in the upright position and secure it with the little thingy. After all are seated, your flight attendant will explain where the emergency exits are.  You are advised to memorize these locations, as you can't read the signs in the dark or with the cabin filled with smoke as you claw your way past the losers who didn't pay attention.
Your flight attendant will also explain the use of the little cup that will drop down in your face for some reason, maybe breathing, which is important. Be sure to listen.
If you land safely at your destination, which usually happens, you may see fellow passengers saying prayers of thanks and kissing the tarmac. This is apparently a tradition in some cultures.

Love these jelly beans...but how many calories? Let's put on my glasses and read the label.
"Warning:  By opening this sealed, airtight package you are legally signifying that you have read and understand the legal document described herein and agree to abide by and be governed by it for the rest of your life and by your heirs in perpetuity.
Definition of Terms:
This document describes the Tyrant-Peasant relationship between the You Betcha Tasty Co.(Tyrant) and you (Peasant).  The product at issue, You Betcha Tasty Co. Jelly Beans will be referred to as (Merch). Authorized consumption of Merch will be called (Nibbling), rapid consumption of Merch will be called (Face-stuffing). The Newtonian force field causing objects to fall will be called (Gravity). Peasant correctional institutions will be call (Slammers).
Terms and Conditions:
This legal, binding agreement governing Peasant's usage or consumption of the enclosed Merch applies everywhere unless they are found to be in conflict with the Jelly Bean Control Act of the State of California. Peasant violators will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law which could result in Slammer confinement of said Peasant. If you do not agree to all of the terms in these Terms and Conditions, do not unwrap, handle the Merch, or subject the Merch to Nibbling or Face-stuffing.
Peasant use of the Merch shall also be restricted at all times to Nibbling or Face-stuffing. At no time shall Merch be loaded into a slingshot or shotgun and launched at high speed. Merch shall not be dropped from tall buildings as the invisible effect of (Gravity) will accelerate Merch (except perhaps in The Bermuda Triangle) and cause injury to Peasants). Merch shall never be sold, leased, or loaned with interest due to third parties  (Sub-Peasants).  Merch shall not be inserted into Peasant's nostrils for comic effect. Use of Merch at Easter time as pretend little-bitty colored Easter Eggs to be hidden for children to find is authorized as long as hiding locations are disinfected and germ-free and approved by local Easter Egg Hunt Laws. 
Limitations of Liability:
Merch is furnished by Tyrant in air-tight package in as-is condition.  It is possible that individual pieces of said Merch has dents, scratches, scars, distressed coverings, or are even squished flat, or melted into a globby lump. Peasant warrants that these conditions are not grounds for refund from Tyrant to Peasant. Merch flavors are provided in roughly equal numbers and fussy Peasants who do not like licorice Merch will not be refunded for possible excessive licorice Merch.  If Merch by chance has 100 percent licorice beans, refund will be provided for one half the retail price paid by Peasant upon presentation of purchase receipt or reasonable facsimile thereof within three business days of purchase date (four business days for Hawaii Peasants). Claims of  too sweet or not sweet enough or blagh taste will not be grounds for refund, Tough Beans! Tummy ache complaints will be ignored by Tyrant since Merch is only lumps of sugar. Tyrant shall not be liable for acne outbreaks or loss of income due to excessive sick days incurred by professional victim Peasants. Although the Merch is described as "beans" it must be understood that Merch components should not be planted in the ground and if planted will not result in magic tall beanstalks growing from them. THE MERCH IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, AND NO WARRANTY, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, IS GIVEN. PEASANT'S USE OF THE MERCH IS AT PEASANT'S SOLE RISK. Tyrant reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Merch (or any part thereof) with or without notice if it be Tyrant's whim. Tyrant  shall not be liable to Peasant or to any third-party for any price doubling or tripling, suspension or discontinuance of the Merch or lack of the best-tasting red beans. 
TRYANT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO COMPLETELY IGNORE THIS AGREEMENT IF TYRANT FEELS LIKE IT. Calories:  130 cal/serving."

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Picasso,
We are pleased to report that we are advancing young Pablo to the first grade at the New School, (Nueva Escuela). He does well in most subject areas.  However, there is one thing;  we had to award Pablo only a provisional passing grade in art. It is not that he fails to do the assignments, indeed he likes to draw and paint. In fact he seems to regard all assignments as requests for painting or drawing.  Perhaps it is a small thing, really, but Pablo's artwork seems more and more to be "off" just a bit, as in drawing a nice cat but with ears kind of extra large and red fangs and some similar oddities.  Mr. Santos suggested Pablo might need eyeglasses for optical correction of his vision. Another example: Pablo drew a horse that looks fine but it has nine legs.  He drew a colorful turkey, nice but for the extra beaks. However, do not worry, Mr. and Mrs. Picasso, these things tend to be just a passing part of growing up.
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Picasso,
You will be pleased to know that Pablo has continued to do well in Spanish, History, and Mathematics. However, our efforts to teach Pablo good artistic technique has not been very successful.  We of course have pointed out any deviations from the norm that often seem to appear in his work, so that he can make corrections, but it is hard going.  We pointed out that he might have a future as an architect, but that his house supported by alligator feet would not be practical. 
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Picasso, 
Well, another year has gone by and that little problem with young Pablo's artwork has not gone away.
Has Pablo suffered any traumatic head injuries in the past? That can lead to erratic behavior.  We don't want Pablo to be held back by failure in just one academic area, so we have brought in a painting tutor especially to help Pablo learn. We must say Pablo is a clever fellow when discussing art and defending his work. He often says things like "Art is the lie that enables us to realize the truth." We are not giving up.  He said today: "To draw, you must close your eyes and sing." I think special remedial classes are needed.
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Picasso,
We are making progress finally on Pablo's irregular artistic tendencies. We have called in Dr. Sigmund Freud, of Vienna,  who has developed a new scientific procedure called psychoanalysis, a clinical method for evaluating and treating pathologies seen as originating from conflicts in the psyche, through dialogue between patient and psychoanalyst, and he has analyzed young Pablo.  Through many talk therapy sessions with Pablo, he is confident he has identified what is going on with the poor boy.  In Pablo's early childhood he was scared by a some entity, he thinks maybe a large chicken or raccoon and this fear has remained dormant in Pablo's subconscious. This causes disruptive patterns in young Pablo's brain and thus crazy drawing. Long story short, Pablo should be treated by gradual introduction of the fearsome entity, that is, a scary chicken, such that Pablo becomes accustomed to this and the unconscious fear subsides, and with it this exasperating nonsense drawing.
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Picasso,
There is good news and bad news with regards your son Pablo.  In collaboration with the above mentioned Dr. Freud, we have obtained a scary, large chicken, named Mable, into the classroom in gradual steps as recommended by Dr. Freud.  Some of the students were afraid of the chicken, but Pablo quickly overcame his initial hesitation to approach Mable, so perhaps the detrimental hidden trauma had lessened as Dr. Freud predicted. That is the good news, but Pablo has not noticeably changed his weird painting style, in fact collaborated with Mable, getting her to step into the oil paints and then to walk about on his painting with her big chicken feet!  This delighted Pablo, who described the technique as "pintura de pollo". Pablo unfortunately misconstrued this whole thing, thinking we had brought the chicken to be his painting assistant and declared this to be a really new artistic method and was proud of his discovery, but was willing to share the credit with me and Dr. Freud.  The next day he brought to school an eggbeater which he used to make many swirling patterns with the oil paints, and declared he would call this "pintura de batidor de huevos". So you see, there is still work to be done.
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Picasso,
We would really like to advance Pablo, but the strange drawings persist and not only that but some of the other students have picked up Pablo's approach to art! Pablo is charismatic and talks endlessly, saying things like "Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life." An interesting thing happened at our monthly art show, parents wanted to buy Pablo's paintings and he said, of course, and garnered about 200 pesetas!  Actually, his "Ballerina's Dreamland" had a mysterious glowing quality that I liked, too.  He says, "Are there rules in pictorial art? Tell me, so I may break them all."  I tell him, Pablo, Pablo, it is fun to play, but after a time you must go out into the real world and and they will not accept Pablo drawings such as you persist to make!"  He said nothing, but showed me his handful of pesetas.  What to do?
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Picasso,
There is a wonderful discovery in the field of psychology called behaviorism developed by B. F. Skinner!  It is so simple, yet effective. He has taught chickens to dance and do tricks!  He is very busy of course, teaching at Harvard, but I was able to contact him and he assures me that some simple applications of his technique can be applied in Pablo's case. We can thus get him to complete some rational, realistic paintings and that will satisfy our academic requirements and then he can make all the estupido drawings he wants after that.  
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Picasso,
Unfortunately our efforts to train Pablo with the incremental behavior-reward steps has not worked. Professor Skinner was greatly interested in Pablo's unusual case and he came himself to apply his methods.  In one attempt, chocolates were given to Pablo one at a time as a reward for sensible bits of drawing, but Pablo didn't eat any chocolates, instead mashed the various bon bons onto his painting! The fillings had different colors, you see, except no blue or green. Naturally the other children wanted candy also, so we had to provide chocolates to them. They ate theirs, though. My classroom is on the edge of chaos! In another attempt, Dr. Skinner painted along with Pablo, leading by example, and we were encouraged that Pablo enjoyed talking about their work, side by side. They were having a good time, but as this progressed, Dr. Skinner began to introduce abstract objects and surreal features in his own painting, and before he left offered to take three of Pablo's scribbles to put in a New York art show! I must say, I did like Pablo's "Kites Without Strings" and our janitor did , too.  
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Picasso,
Good news.  Our mathematics teacher, Ms. Gargiola, has suggested a three-step solution for this frustrating situation:  Step One: We get Pablo to complete some paint-by-number paintings of boring subjects by paying him one peseta per color.  Step Two: We photograph these realistic works and put the results in Pablo's student file. Step Three: We let Pablo paint over all these paintings with whatever crazy stuff his little heart desires, as long he doesn't show it to us.  We accomplished this and thus we have been able to advance Pablo with good grades in all subjects.  I had an interesting note from Dr. Freud, it seems he has taken up abstract painting and sent photos of his work, which is totally crazy stuff, indeed, one was "Carl Jung Descending a Staircase" a baffling work giving even Pablo a run for his money.

Transcript of personnel interview, Daily Planet Corporation, 2/8/2022 by Al Dunlap
"Please sit down, Mr. Cantor."  
"My name is Kent, Clark Kent."
"Ah, yes, Kent.  Mr. Kent, as you probably know, The Daily Planet has been purchased by ACME International Corporation, so we are reviewing all personnel.  And, Mr. Cantor, ah, Kent, I've looked at your personnel file and I'm afraid there won't be a place for you in our new streamlined workforce."
"Oh my Gosh!  But surely my boss, Perry White, will want me to stay on."
"I'm afraid Mr. White was terminated this morning.  James Olsen is the new Editor-in-Chief."
"Jimmy Olsen?? Gasp!.......Sir, I know my longtime colleague, Lois Lane, will vouch for me as a veteran reporter."
"Ah, but Ms. Lane is also no longer employed here, so I can't ask her.  Mr. Kent, I see here your age is 118, well past the mandatory retirement age."
"But that was waived by my boss."
"Not valid anymore, my friend, as your former boss is out the door.  Your personnel record is not good.  Your report of the Hindenburg landing in New Jersey in 1937 makes no mention of the fact that it burst into flames, killing 36 people."
"It did?  Well, many times there can be errors because of the need for reporting the news quickly."
"Mr. Kent, you reported the Japanese attacked the Galapagos Islands in 1941, not Hawaii!  You reported Thomas Dewey won the 1948 presidential election which was won by Harry Truman.  You reported that Henry VIII died, making Queen Elizabeth the new monarch when it was actually George VI.  You reported Neil Armstrong landed on Mars!"
"Well, many reporters got that wrong.  Moon, Mars, what's the diff?"
"Mr. Kent, your performance rating is an atrocious 1 on a scale of 0 to 10.  You missed 1,338 weekly editorial meetings, and you left the office without punching out 734 times.  Also, you damaged several typewriters by hitting the keys too hard and breaking them.  Must I go on?  In 1983, you twisted the doorknob off a locked supply room door.  In 1964, you attempted to kill a spider and stomped a hole in the concrete sidewalk in front of the Daily Planet building."
"Sir, it was already cracked."
"I see here you lost a court case and your pay is attached to pay for property damage to a certain Doctor Luthor.  Is there anything good in your record?  Have you ever gotten a scoop?"
"What's a scoop?"
"Mr. Kent, considering your dismal record, I can only offer you a job as a newsboy.  There is an opening at one of the Bowery streets."
"What does a newsboy do?"
"A newsboy stands on a busy street-corner and hawks the papers.  You have to be able to lug around a big bundle of papers.  Can you lift 50 pounds, Mr. Kent?"
"Not a problem, I'll show you........"
"Whoa, Kent!   Put down my desk, stuff is falling off it!"
"Mr. Dunlap, do you have any steel bars I can bend for you?  Oh, oh!  Is that a siren, Mr. Dunlap?  My hearing is not so good as I get older."
"Why, yes, that's a siren."
"Sorry, Mr. Dunlap, I just remembered an important appointment I must keep.  Is there a telephone booth near this building?"
"Yes, on the corner.....but Kent, you can't just take off...come back here!
