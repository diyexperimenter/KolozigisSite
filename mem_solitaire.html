<H3>The MemSolitaire Program</H3>
<P>Most people are familiar with the solitaire game having seven stacks and a deck to deal from,
   as shown in the screenshot below.  But this game is fun with a purpose:  as you bring up the
   ace, two, three, etc. to the tops of the stacks, instead of just making four ace stacks, you 
   must place each card on its matching word in French.  If you are wrong, the card flies back 
   to where you dragged it from.  If correct, it "sticks" and allows subsequent cards to be 
   played.</P>
<P>The sample files are some French-English pairs.  I will try to get time to add some 
   Spanish-English pairs, and some things like Element-Atomic Number/Atomic Weight pairs, just to 
   test the variety that may work.  You can write your own pairs very simply with any ASCII text
   editor like Windows NotePad:  just save-as one of the files that presently work as your new 
   name.  Then write in your own words (or numbers) between the existing quotation marks and 
   save the file. Run MemSolitaire and select your new text file and you should get your new 
   word set to appear. (Note that you have to select a new "Deal" to get the new word set to 
   appear.)</P>
<P>Please e-mail me with comments.  I'll try to keep these maintained. (I may have to charge 
   something in the future to keep these available).</P>
