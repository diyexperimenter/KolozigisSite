    <H2>Puzzle Learning Cards</H2>
        <BR>
	<P> Here is a C# program I wrote to read in a .txt file having alternate questions and answers, one line each, 
		and print out four pages of puzzle cards having q and a's matching when you arrange the cards correctly 
		in a six by six pattern. I used "cover stock" 67 lb paper available from Staples. It is pretty thick, but
		does barely feed in the printer I have (HP Envy). Then you can laminate. Staples can do lamination. They
		can also copy onto some thick glossy paper that is almost like playing cards, without lamination. Just cut
		with scissors along the lines to get a small deck of cards the same size as playing cards.  Assemble them
		similar to a jigsaw puzzle, matching the correct answer with each question.  Fun to do and you can make
		many decks with all your own course content.  You learn while making up the text files and then learn
		again as you assemble the cards each time.  Also you could prompt chatgpt (still available free as of
		4/25/2023) to make the text files for you in the right format.</P>
