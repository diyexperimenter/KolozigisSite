Greetings Parish Care folks.  Below find the 20 stories written by Billy Bob and sent out in the past year or two.  

Library Cats


“Mom, I have to write a story for school tomorrow.  Miss Beasley says we can get help to write the words but it has to be our story that we made up.”

“Billy can help you,  I’m working on these tax returns,” said Mom.

"Kathy is only four and can’t read or write yet, Billy, so you need to help her.” 

“But Mom, I want to play baseball with Mickey outside.”

“After you help your little sister.”

“Awww, Mom!”  said Billy.

Billy is eight and writes and spells pretty well. 

“I’ll tell you the words and you write it down for me, OK, Billy?”

“OK, OK, let’s hurry up with your stupid, boring story,  I want to go outside and play ball with Mickey.” 

“Start this way,” said Kathy,  “Miss Abigail Francis was the beautiful new librarian at the Smithville Public Library. ”

Billy wrote: “Abbie Freaky was an old bag and got a new job- Slimeville Town Library.”

“Did you write the first sentence?”

“Yep, I wrote it.  Now what?”

Kathy continued: “She loved her new job and kept all the books in good order and everything was very neat and she was friendly with all the library patrons.”

Billy wrote:
“She wore U.S. Army combat boots and smoked cigarettes and left all the books on the floor.”

Kathy continued:  “She also loved cats and each day she would bring her cat Furball with her and Furball would sit on the counter and watch as people checked out the books.”

Billy wrote:
“The grouchy old woman had a big bulldog who growled and scared the customers.”

Kathy said:  “Mrs. Harper said it wasn’t proper to have a cat in the library as it might get cat fur on the books. It was against town rules.”

Billy wrote:  “Two big troopers came in and handcuffed Miss Freaky and slapped her in jail for violating a town ordinance.”

Kathy said:  “A patron told about her friend who was very sad, and Miss Francis said why not take Furball when you visit to cheer her up.”

Billy wrote: “The town manager heard about the arrest and he came to the jail to fire her from the library job.”

Kathy said: “That made the friend very happy, and so she started to loan out cats because she had several.”

Billy wrote: “Grizzly the bulldog went tearing around the library chewing up thousands of books.  The place was a shambles.”

Kathy said:  “She loaned them out to anyone who was sad or lonely, just like library books, and had a library card for each one.  It was for two weeks at a time, unless renewed.”

Billy wrote: “The town presented Miss Freaky with a bill for $150,000 for damages.”

Kathy said:  “Then the townspeople could see what a good thing it was and they let her have as many cats in the library as she wanted!”

Billy wrote: “Miss Freaky’s boyfriend Clyde helped her break out of jail (a felony) and they escaped in a stolen car.”

Kathy said:  “Not only that, but children loved to come to the library to pet the cats and many more came to borrow books than before.”

Billy wrote: “Abbie and Clyde took to robbing stores and soon were wanted in six states.”

Kathy said:  “Miss Francis was delighted when she was given a special award by the local school for encouraging reading!”

Billy wrote: “Both Abbie and Clyde were arrested after a high-speed chase in Las Vegas and are now serving hard time in San Quentin Federal Prison.”

“Is it done?” asked Kathy. “Thanks, Billy.”

“No problem.”

“Now I can pass it in to Miss Beasley. I’ll bet she’ll like it.”

“I’m sure she will, Kathy, it’s not as boring as I thought.”

From the American Juvenile Deliquent Boy Doll Collection ® #13:
 TOM SAWYER
Congratulations on your intelligent purchase of this authentic Tom Sawyer ® doll, hand crafted in our factory and each one signed by Mark Twaine!
For best enjoyment, please follow these recommendations: 
1. Do not allow your household pet such as a large vicious dog or alligator to chew on Tom ® or damage may occur.
2. Do not attempt to bathe Tom ® or dunk him in water for a swim as this will result in disintegration of his cardboard tube arms and legs.
3. You'll have hours of fun with Accessory #19, Tom's ® fishing pole and dead mackerel!  Please remember, however, that this is a PRETEND fish made of plaster- do not attempt to cook and eat Tom's Dead Mackerel ® as damaged teeth and indigestion may occur. Do not pretend to be a fish and put the hook and Tom's Wiggly Worm ® in your mouth as injury or vomiting may result.
4. Do not playfully rip off Tom's ® arms or legs or head. They are permanently attached at the factory. If accidentally removed, sorry, you should have been more careful.
5. Do not throw Tom ® off tall buildings as damage may occur. Do not drop Tom ® into piles of mud, dirt, or slime.
6. Tom ® comes with a fine straw hat (Accessory #7). You will have hours of fun removing and replacing Tom's ® boater hat, but please notice that it has an OVAL shape to fit Tom's ® somewhat squashed head (necessitated by factory efficiency requirements and protecting the environment), so it only fits ONE WAY, Charley! Do not force with a fist or hammer or damage may occur.
7. Tom ® comes with an authentic river raft (Accessory #9) and you will have hours of fun recreating the rollicking adventures of the real (fictitious) Tom ®  and his disreputable friends.  However, despite the name, the raft does not actually float and if placed in water it will sink like a rock along with Tom ®.
8. Accessory #14, Tom's Crackling Campfire ® is made of plastic logs and red cellophane. Do not use matches or a blowtorch to light it as damage may result and cyanide gas may be released resulting in copious acrid smoke and dead family members.
9. Do not attempt to recreate Tom's ® adventure "Tickling Alligators", related in Ref. 1 below; you could be bitten or eaten.
10. In the rollicking adventure "Tom Finds a Rusty Pistol", Ref. 1, Tom ® finds a rusty pistol.  Accessory #19 is a full size replica rusty pistol.  Do not attempt to place real .45 caliber bullets in it as it is only a plastic replica. If bullets are accidentally rammed into it, do not attempt to remove them with pliers or chisels as explosions and injuries may result.
11. CAUTION: If you happen to find a dead cat, as Tom ® did, do not carry it around wishing to trade it for marbles, jacknives, etc., as disease and bad odors may result.  Instead bury the dead cat, respectfully marking the spot.  If you live in a city with sidewalks everywhere, find a park.  Note: Dark of night is your friend when digging a grave in a park.
12. Accessory #17, Tom's Bowie Knife ®, is a full size razor sharp Solingen steel throwing knife deemed to be dangerous in California.  You will have hours of fun recreating Tom's ® frontier adventures. Although this knife could be used to repel rabid dogs or bears, it is not to be used in personal disputes or crimes.  Do not attempt Tom's ® "William Tell Trick", (Ref. 1), as injury could result.
13. The real (fictitious) Tom ® enjoyed playing with explosive devices such as throwing lit firecrackers into Aunt Polly's hen house. Therefore, we have made available Accessory #5, Tom's Big Box of Firecrackers ®.  
While amusing and fun, explosive devices may result in loss of hands, arms, legs, or heads.
CAUTION:  These are not pretend firecrackers; they have gunpowder in them, if lit they will explode. Do not hold in your hand while exploding as painful loss of fingers may result. Not to be thrown at pets or friends while exploding, especially Tom's Whopping Big Firecracker ®, as injury, death, or ill feelings may result.
14. After many hours of riotous fun you'll have playing with Tom ®, you may find that Tom ® becomes a little soiled or covered with grease or slime or gobs of dirt all over him. In that case refer to Item 15. How To Clean Your Tom Sawyer ® Doll.
15. How To Clean Your Tom Sawyer ® Doll. There is no way to clean your Tom Sawyer ® doll.  Perhaps you did not heed Caution 5. above; too late now.
16. CAUTION regarding Accessory #23, Tom's Crooked Poker Deck ®. This exciting deck of cards has extra aces just like the one a riverboat gambler gave to Tom ®.  Tom ® had loads of fun with these amusing cards, once scamming a tidy sum from the gullible Widow Parker. However, please refrain from using these crooked cards to cheat your friends or family.  Especially avoid swindling police officers as they tend to have no sense of humor.
17. You may recall the real (fictitious) Tom ® had a lot of fun putting live bees in friend's lunch boxes and his teacher's desk drawers.  Therefore we have made available Accessory #6, Tom's Box of Bumble Bees ®.  These are not pretend bees, but actual live bees with stingers.  Caution: DO NOT OPEN Tom's Box of Bumble Bees ®! To enjoy and have hours of fun, peek at the bees through the little screen door. Do not open the door as they will sting you and then die, not a happy result for either party.
18. On dark moonless nights Hannibal residents walking past the cemetery might be startled when they saw two ghostly figures moaning eerie sounds and lurching towards them.  (The furtive figures would be Tom and Huck wearing ragged white sheets.)  
You can have hours of fun re-enacting this exciting gambit by dressing Tom ® with Accessory #15, Tom's Spooky Ghost Sheet ®.  For most fun, visit a dark cemetery when it is windy with leaves blowing around.  Help Tom jump out at gullible passersby.  They will scream with fear and run. Ha, ha, ha. Not to be used to scare babies or dogs with sharp teeth.
Warning: If you are a timid child do not play "ghosts" with Tom ®. If Tom ® accidentally becomes clothed with the terrifying ghost costume and you run away screaming, remember it is just Tom ®.  Take a deep breath and repeat aloud "It is just Tom ®.  It is just Tom ®."  over and over.  Also repeat "Tom ® is alive and well."  (Well, although Tom ® is very life-like, he is not really alive since he is an inanimate toy.)
19. Tom and Huck pretty much subscribed to the moral principle of "Finders Keeper, Losers Weepers."  So Tom happily scurried home with a box of gold coins, watch, and jewelry he found in the attic of the long-abandoned Eldridge house. Unfortunately for Tom, all the items were theater props, as he and Huck found out when they tried to buy cigars with one of the fake gold coins.
You'll have hours of fun with Accessory #11, Tom's Treasure Trove ®. You can re-enact Tom's ® exciting adventure, especially if there is a long-abandoned house in your neighborhood and you have burglar tools. (Make sure a house is actually abandoned before entering and looking for treasure.)
20. It won't be a surprise to you that we have made available Accessory #17,
Tom's Electric Shock Joke ®. What fun you'll have when you offer your teachers or not-so-good friends a stick of delicious gum and when they put their greedy fingers on it- surprise! a whopper of an electric shock! Caution:
Select gullible victims who have a sense of humor or are smaller than you.
21. When pretending Tom ® is eating something such as a dead mackerel (see Item 3 above), remember that his mouth does not actually open.  Do not attempt to modify Tom ® with sharp instruments as damage may occur.
Frequently Asked Questions:
Q. Why does Tom ® have a bald spot like a Franciscan Monk?
A. For best factory efficiency we used hair from our "Gabby, The Franciscan Monk" doll.
Q. Why do Tom's ® arms and legs look like toilet paper tubes?
A. They are toilet paper tubes.
Q. My child is scared of "Spooky Tom" and cries and cries and has nightmares.
A. Tough, Lady.  Buy a Raggety Ann.
Q. I attempted a raft adventure with Tom ® but raft and Tom ® sank like a rock.
A. Well, Duh!  See Item 7 above.
Q. We are having hours of fun with Tom ®, but he has a goofy face.  Can I draw a better face on the back of his head?
A. Tom's ® face is not goofy, but actually a subtle artistic rendering expressing the sardonic and mischievous nature of a Hannibal, MO juvenile deliquent probably headed for a life of crime.  We hope you do not create a bizarro figure with his feet pointed backwards.  Warranty void in such a case.
Q. I received my Tom Sawyer ® doll but I can't get him to sing.  I looked everywhere for a switch. I want him to sing! sing! sing!
A. We are sorry, but Tom ® does not sing.  Perhaps you are thinking of our "Billy Bob" ® doll.  Billy ® sings "Mr. Wonderful", "Rainy Day", "The Coffee Song" and other popular songs in a pleasing baritone voice.  Please see our latest catalog for details.
Q. We are having hours of fun with our Tom ® doll.  However, our attempts to stage a minstrel show featuring Tom ® tap dancing have failed.  Did you even ship tap dancing shoes with him?
A. Alas, there is some confusion here.  As far as we know, the real (fictional) Tom Sawyer did not tap dance, therefore we have not provided tap dancing accessories.  Is it possible you have been reading our advertisements for our "Clickety-Clack, The Tap Dancer" ® doll?  He can be purchased from our catalog (enclosed) and would be ideal for your minstrel show.
Q. We are happy with our Tom ® doll but did not see any shoes in with all his accessories.  Please send.
A. Oh my gosh!  We are embarrassed as we shipped thousands of Tom ® dolls without shoes.  You know how things are sometimes, can't remember everything!  Do you happen to have some leather and cobbler's tools?  If so, you know, you could make some little shoes for Tom ®.  Good luck.

An Eccentric Pamphlet
(A review by Prof. Elbert Handle-Bipford, PhD., Ncs., Hfd., Oxford University)
 Hidden amongst the heavier tomes I acquired at an estate sale this past Thursday at No. 67 Turnberry Cross Road was a curious and colorful pamphlet, 8 x 10 inches in size, quite shopworn. Its front cover looked like a circus poster, its title in yellow letters, “Superman and the Ant-Men”.    At first I thought it was a show guide for a fanciful opera, long-since sung and forgotten, but there were no singers or musical pieces listed, nor ads for hats and finery shops, no, it was in fact a bizarre form of narrative. 
My curiosity only increased as I examined each garish page.  The author may have studied ancient Egyptian wall paintings and added one more element, namely, printed words associated with each line drawing of a figure, such that the reader might surmise which figure originated those particular words.  
Not to be thrown off by this eccentricity, I read further.  As we begin, no character called ’Superman’ is in sight.  Instead we have some boring discussion amongst employees at a bank or insurance company.  Somebody named Jimmy hasn’t returned from the pizza run. Where can he be?  The boss, Perry, assigns a dorky person, Clark, to go find him and says, “Make it snappy, there is work to do!”  But this shifty Clark fellow makes some lame excuse about how he can‘t find his glasses, so the gum-snapping office valley girl, Lois, decides to go find Jimmy.   But then it gets confusing. 
Apparently this guy Clark Kent has a twin brother, an identical twin. You can’t tell one from the other from their face or body build.  But there is an important difference.  Kent’s twin is a deluded mental case who has rather grandly given himself the name ’Superman’.  Worse, he is not presently confined to an appropriate mental institution.  You can see this could lead to trouble and you won’t be disappointed.   This same fellow, no doubt his real name is Bill Kent, or something, but we never find out, he just goes by his ‘Superman’ name.  It’s not just the name, he has this kind of close-fitting pajama outfit and wears his yellow Jockey underwear shorts on the outside.  We can guess he is embarrassed by the pajama clothes because he keeps them hidden under a pretty ordinary suit and tie.  We can guess that he is not too bright, in addition to being insane, because he thinks nobody can see him when he is in a glass phone booth, changing clothes. 
 Jimmy, we discover, did not return with the pizza for a very good reason.  He fell into a hole in a vacant lot and landed in a tunnel.  There are ant people in the tunnel who quickly capture Jimmy. Who are these ant people, anyway?  Before they inject poor Jimmy with a serum which will make him a kind of zombie who obeys all ant commands, they take the trouble to give him a little tour and a short lecture about the history of the ant people, who have some amount of pride, as we all do.  A billion-year evolutionary process in parallel with our own has resulted in the intelligent creatures we see in the drawings.  They are as large as humans, and have six legs.  Their heads have big bug eyes and they complain about poor vision.  Some of them have reading glasses with hundreds of lenses.  They walk on two legs and use the other four for reading newspapers, playing cards, and other stuff.  Looks like they can shuffle two decks at once. Funny thing is, they talk perfect English, but with a kind of staticky stutter.  They carefully explain to Jimmy their plan to soon inject everybody who goes through the subway turnstiles, thus netting large numbers of zombies per day.
Meanwhile, we see what Clark Kent’s brother is up to.  He’s got on his Superman suit and now we enter his delusionary mind:  the poor schlemiel is a real whacko,  he thinks he’s leaped into the sky, and keeps going, gravity doesn’t count with this guy!  His eyes become flashlights and illuminate objects not normally visible.  Apparently, he heard about Jimmy being missing and is looking for him, too (In his mind).
Kent’s brother talks to himself, too.  As the delusions proceed, he mutters that there is too much LEAD ORE in the earth around the city of Metropolis and he doesn’t like it one bit! 
Look!  They’ve let Jimmy go!  He returns to the jubilant co-workers, however, something’s not right.  He tries to convince everybody to take subway rides.  He won’t stop talking about the subway, and quits his job, and gets a job with the subway authority in their advertising department. 
Now we see Clark pondering; he passes a movie theater.  There’s a zombie movie playing…   this apparently makes him think of a light bulb.   He goes to find Jimmy and makes him sneeze with some sneezing powder, explaining, “Just a joke, Jimmy, ha, ha, ha!”  Rudely grabbing Jimmy’s hanky, he now has a sample of Jimmy’s saliva.  Are you still with me? 
Now it gets muddy.  I guess Clark and Bill talk often, because we see not Clark Kent, but Superman studying the saliva in a well equipped science lab!  Superman doesn’t seem to have a job, where does he get the money for the fancy lab?  The saliva is analyzed.  Poor Jimmy is loaded with the same devious chemical compound that ants use to control their aphid slaves!  Now we are cooking.
Now Superman has another flying delusion about visiting an earthquake detection center and getting them to home in on any sounds of the same frequency that ants are known to communicate with.
More likely he just called on the phone.  These earthquake guys work fast;  we soon see a map pinpointing a source of tell-tale vibrations.  Surprise! It’s that vacant lot in Metropolis! 
Now another really wild delusion! Superman not only leaps into the sky with a perfect 10-mile trajectory, landing exactly  on the ants’ tunnel entrance, but he tears big gaping holes in the ground, exposing the varmints.  They fight back with weapons that look a lot like crossbows.  Army units have been called and all the thousand or so ant people are captured.
Dramatic, but we know they just called the army guys.
You’ll be glad to know that it was possible to counteract the zombie serum.  Jimmy takes that medicine and a lot of strong coffee and is soon back at the same dreary office with the others, laughing and playing tricks like putting Clark’s carbon paper in backwards when he’s not looking and hiding his glasses. 
Now let’s think about what our author is really up to.  One might think this story is an entertaining tale of a challenge by a menacing force and its eventual defeat.  But we ask,  is the real goal to probe the reader’s psyche?  Is the real goal to peel away surface fraud that encrusts each and every one of us?  No, it’s just another stupid story.

Letter From Camp

Just a "Hello"          from your camper,
it's still raining;        getting damper.
Sorry for the             soggy letter.
A big bear ripped up our tent and made it wetter.

To scare bears off      they say noise will,
we did show that        screaming boys will.
Didn't get me              or Bob Dempsey,
but they found the camp refrigerator empty.

I had fun with            Johnny Patches,
In a game of              Slingshot Matches.
There's a trick that   I'm still learning,
to shoot quickly        while it's burning.                 
But a problem           sometimes happens,
you might get a little bill for burned-down cabins.

It's fun helping           all the camp guys,
using small saws        or the big size.             
Just use power            don't be queasy,
cutting tall trees         is so easy.
We cut twenty             part of Earth Day,
so please get me a gas chainsaw for my birthday.

Have you heard of      an old camp song,
"Hello Momma"         maybe that's wrong,
"Hello Daddah"          something like that,
silly rhyming               jokes that fall flat.
Dad, of course you     would not be one,
to make fun of            your poor young son.
If it happened             to be funny,
I guess it could           bring in some money.
Please respect our      family loyalties.
If you do write songs I think I should get royalties.

By Lake Erie               we were wading,
the camp crew was    excavating,
What a cool guy          Mr. Crozer,
he let us drive             his bulldozer.
A small lever               was marked "Forward",
I went backward         which was shore-ward.
It was just a                little blunder,
I jumped out but Mr. Crozer's rig went under.

A warped arrow           will not fly straight,
you may find out          when it's too late.
It may go lower,           it may go higher,
causing damage             to transpire.
Stained glass windows   though they look 
                                         strong,
struck with arrows        they don't last long.
Please remember           before blaming,
these things don't always go where one is aiming.

Me and Sharkey         and Ben Tyding,
saddled up for            horseback riding.
There was bad news  and the source is,
Camp G. didn't           own the horses.
Angry farmers            in due course meant,
they would call in       law enforcement.
I don't mean to           cause excitement,
but it could mean       three indictments.
The camp lawyer        Mr. Kiners,
says the jail time might be short because we're minors.

We got sparklers        from Ms. Trackers,
And some giant          firecrackers.
Until now I                 had no notion,
how to make a           big explosion.
It was easy                 using science,
just put bullets in a microwave appliance.

We got haircuts         from John Tunney.
My new Mohawk's    kind of funny.
I have presents          though not many,
not forgetting            sister Penny.
She will laugh when        I surprise her,
it's a little                        box of spiders.
We played card games    with Coach Roker,
and I lost a thousand dollars playing poker.


We watched workers    take a stump out.
Dynamite sure               made it jump out.
It threw dirt up             and big rocks, too,
just don't let them         come down on you.
They were good to        me and Andy,
we got ten sticks each and they will come in handy.

We are learning         native culture,
tomahawks and        totem sculpture.
I learned how to        throw a hatchet.
It is fun to                  try to catch it. 
We did art with          Mr. Kimble,
pictograms and          native symbols.
foxes, snakes and      giant beetles.
We all got a chance to use the tattoo needles.  

Sorry for the           motor boat loss,
Benny Parker         saw it float off.
I did use a               rope and knot it,
(possibly I               just forgot it),
It won't go too        far in theory,
that Chris Craft is surely somewhere on Lake Erie.

Not much news here    so I'll end now.
Any cookies                 you can send now?
Don't let bad news       be a damper,
please plan four weeks next year for your happy camper.

Just one thing, Dad,     I was thinking,
you like singing           when you're drinking.
You show lots of         flare for music,
you've got talent         why not use it?
If it means a                shot at glory,
just between us, I could fabricate some stories.

AP Wire Service June 19, 2021
Testimony was heard today in Metropolis City Small Claims Court pertaining to a property damage suit against Clark Kent, age 118, a long-time reporter for The Daily Planet.  According to the plaintiff, Dr. L. Luthor, Mr. Kent became agitated upon learning that the multi-vitamins the doctor had prescribed contained one percent kryptonite, whereupon Mr. Kent smashed his fist through the brick wall in the doctor's office.
“I was surprised and frightened by Mr. Kent's actions.” said Dr. Luthor.  In further testimony, he described how Mr. Kent picked up his heavy mahogany desk and sent it crashing through his office window to the courtyard below.
“Up until now I have always considered Mr. Kent to be mild-mannered.” said Dr. Luthor.  “I knew he was in good health for his age, “ he added, “but he is much stronger than most of my patients.  He also stomped out of my office to the parking lot and picked up my BMW sedan and slammed it upside down in a ditch!”
The defendant, Mr. Kent, said that he may have over-reacted, but asked that the court magistrate take his advanced age into account and also the fact that he was allergic to kryptonite. 
During the proceedings it came to light that Mr. Kent had declined to have his fingerprints taken, which was considered a contempt of court infraction and led to a quick finding for the plaintiff. The total damages of $73,245 will be paid to Dr. Luthor at the rate of $19 per month, attached from Mr. Kent's $44 per month wages, until paid in full.

Fact checking note: AP Wire Service cannot vouch for the accuracy of the reference to kryptonite.  Krypton is an inert gas. Under extreme conditions krypton reacts with fluorine to form the gas KrF2, but quickly dissociates into unbound atoms.

AP News: NYC

A man dressed in a tight-fitting Spandex blue suit with red cape and red boots was arrested today and charged with running on foot 90 miles per hour down the JFK Expressway.  The high-speed pursuit using flashing lights and sirens ended near 42nd Street when NYC Police cruisers caught up with him and pulled him over.  The colorful gentleman, who gave his name as Sue Perman, stated that he had to run fast to catch the penguin he was pursuing.  

Sgt. Joe Friday, speaking to reporters of the incident, was skeptical.  “We just want the facts, and the fact is there are no penguins around here except maybe in the Bronx Zoo.  I asked Mr. Perman if he perhaps was chasing pigeons, as New York has them in abundance, however Mr. Perman remarked that was not the case and added that he hated pigeons because they got in his way when he was flying. When asked for identification, he said he did not have a driver's license or social security card because he was not born on Earth, but on the planet Krypton. I will make no judgments about this gentleman's sanity, but we are checking local mental health facilities to determine if there are any missing patients.” 

Amidst the beeping horns and traffic snarl Mr. Perman protested that there was no New York State or municipal law restricting the speed of runners, and this caused considerable hesitation on the part of the police officers, who discussed the matter, and  thought a charge of jaywalking might apply.  

Traffic was at a standstill because of the police cruisers and many New Yorkers gathered to observe the brightly clothed man being taken into custody.  A large city bus was parked at an awkward angle, blocking one lane and its driver was somewhat angry.  We interviewed the driver, a Mr. Ralph Kramden who said, “That guy ran right in front of me, weaving in and out of traffic.  He's a nut case!  Get him off the road!”  

These remarks were overheard by Mr. Perman and he left the scene without being charged after all.  He was somewhat miffed as evidenced by his parting remarks calling Mr. Kramden “Tubby” and telling Sgt. Friday to “Lose the 1940's fedora, Flatfoot!”.

Fact-checking note:  Penguins are not native to New York City.  They can walk on land, but only about two miles per hour.  In water they can swim up to 5.6 miles per hour.

Another report from Metro News' Our World, October 22, 2021:
Today I continued my "Man in the Street" interviews, this time in Topeka, Kansas.  I approached a down-and-out fellow lolling on a dusty curb clutching a paper bag in the shape of a bottle.
"Sir, you look familiar.  Were you in a 1930's movie about a tornado?"
"Get lost, lady!"
"My Gosh, are you that fellow with the funnel hat-  the Tin Man?"
"That bum gig!  Don't remind me... I got rusty in the rain and sore feet from walking on those hot yellow bricks... and all I got was union scale!"
"Wow! You're famous, Mr. Tin Man!"
"Bah!  Take after take in the hot sun- ever touch tin in the hot sun, girly?  $#@&^% wind machine blew sand into my joints!"
"But Sir, that movie was a classic."
"Yah, yah, &*^%$%$#  Cowardly Lion mugged it up...tried to upstage me every scene!"
"But did it lead to a movie career?"
"Hah! the studios stereotyped me, you know.  No leading man offers.  Almost got a sidekick role with Roy Rogers, but that Gabby Hayes waddled onto the set with his bushy beard and talking through his nose just to get attention."
The aging trouper paused to take a swig from his paper bag, and then continued.
"I did read for the lead in 'Sunset Boulevard' but they realized I couldn't float in the opening pool scene, so no dice there.  My old Hollywood pal, The Michellin Tire Man tried to teach me to swim...'course he bobbed around like a cork, I went straight to the bottom.
Say Missy, you got a couple bucks you can spare?  I'm thirsty, all this talkin' does make a body thirsty."
"Well, I guess so, Mr. Tin Man."
"You know, I couldn't get no parts.  Did a lousy Pennzoil commercial.  Auditioned for 'Star Wars', but that @#^%$&^  C3PO beat me out with his cheap flashy gold look and fake British accent!
They didn't let me do my tap dance routine in that Oz B movie- don't need no taps in my shoes, got steel feet!  I'll show ya!"
"Mr. Tin Man, be careful, you're older now!"
I took his metal hand, rusty with age, and helped him to his feet.  He did some dance steps, but his stovepipe legs wobbled and he suddenly collapsed in a clanking heap!
"Oh, I hope you're OK."
"Well, I haven't practised for awhile.  Got a few dents...^%$#%$^& curbstones are hard!  Say, listen, you got a few bucks for some Bondo body filler to fix these dents?

Overheard at the Department of Motor Vehicles:
"Mr. Wayne, I see that you've requested the vanity plate name "BATMOBILE" .  I'm sorry, but that has too many letters.  What other name would you like?"
"Well, actually it's for my friend's car.  How about 'BATCAR'?  Not really the best, but...."
"No, I'm sorry but that's taken by another person, a Mr. T. Joker."
"Whaaaaat??!! It can't be... that miserable cur!... I mean...my friend is going to be very disappointed.  How about 'BATONE'?"
"Sorry, but that's been assigned to Mortimer Penguin of this city."
"Holy Moly!?!   I can't believe it!!"
"Mr. Wayne, I could give you 'BATTY', how about that?"
"No, no, no...."
"Well, we could do 'BATZY',   or 'BATBOY' "
"No, no, no....are you crazy?"
"Sir, there are people waiting in line.  I see on your application you haven't specified the make and model of your vehicle.  You need to fill those in."
"Well, I didn't know what to put there...I hate forms.  I guess the model is 'Batmobile' and it was made by ACME Company."
"Sir, ACME is not on our list of recognized automobile manufacturers, so you will have to register it as an Experimental Vehicle, and we will have to put the letters 'XV' on your plate."
"No, that's terrible, it messes up my name... I mean my friend's name."
"Sir, we'll also need the vehicle serial number."
"Serial number?   #@$%^^%  !  I'll have to call Robin, I mean my friend, to find the #@$%^^%  serial number, if there even is one!  Is there a pay phone around here?"
"No, they took it out. Everybody's got a cell phone now."
"Cell phone!   What's a cell phone?"
"It's a phone you carry with you."
"But where do you plug it in?"
"Don't need to, it's wireless."
"Really?  I'll have to tell my friend about that!" 
"One more thing, Sir.  I see your vehicle's model year is 1939.  That means it has to be registered as an antique and have the letter 'A' as a prefix on the plate.  So that leaves room for only three more letters or numbers."
"Whaaaat! This is unbelievable, this is why people hate the DMV!"
"Also, Sir, I see you are applying for a charitable non-profit discount..."
"Yes, you see I'm... my friend is a crime fighter and performs a valuable public service at no charge."
"Oh, you mean he is a bounty hunter, like Dog, The Bounty Hunter?"
"No, no,  he does work with law enforcement to catch criminals, but never charges a fee."
"So he works with law enforcement?"
"Yes, the police commissioner often requests his help."
"Really?....say, Mr.....ah..Mr. Wayne, you know last week I got a ticket for speeding and I have to go to court, but I was only just slightly speeding..."
"Uh huh,  well listen, what did you say your name was again?"
"It's John."
"Well, John, I always say, 'You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours'.   That court appearance might disappear if I get that 'BATMOBILE' plate with no #@$%^^%  'AXV' letters attached!"
"Shhhh!....Not so loud, Mr. Wayne.   (whisper)  OK, you got it.  'BATMOBILE' it is, and forget about that serial number!"

Transcript, audio recording left on after a show in 1955
"Whew, I'm glad those Peanut Gallery kids are gone...they can't sing worth a darn.  Hey, Clarabell, that's a wrap.  Let's get outta here and have a drink at Winky's bar across the street!"
"Honk, Honk."
"Buffalo Bob..."
"Yes, Howdy?"
"Buffalo Bob, I'd like to go to Winky's, too, you know.  I don't like to complain but every day at 6:00 PM it gets real quiet... we're all having fun and singing and dancing and laughing and then every day after the show I don't have any fun.  Just stay all kind of slumped in a corner until the next show."
"Howdy, remember how I explained to you how you're a puppet and that has some limitations- can't always sing and dance?"
"Buffalo Bob, that joke you told today about me trying to get a staring role in the western movie 'High Noon'...you said 'not unless somebody pulled strings for him!' and everybody laughed, but I don't get the joke."
"Well, Howdy, I was referring to your strings."
"What strings, Buffalo Bob?"
"Howdy, you know you are a real star- you can sing, dance and act and the kids love how animated and lively you are and here's the thing:  it's the strings that animate you."
"But Buffalo Bob, I know I'm not grown up yet, but I'm a big boy, a big rootin' tootin' cowboy- don't need no strings!"
"Howdy, let's talk some more tomorrow- got a big show tomorrow, Princess Summerfall Winterspring is coming..."
"I'm a real boy, Buffalo Bob."
"No, you're a puppet, Kiddo, and good thing, you know, if you were a real boy NBC would have to pay you union scale and this is a low budget show and you probably wouldn't have this job!" 
"Sure I ACT like a puppet, but that's my shtick, Buffalo Bob."
"Howdy, ever wonder why your voice sounds a lot like mine?  Do you remember that time I got the hiccups and you got the hiccups at the same time.  I couldn't shake them until Clarabell squirted me in the face with his seltzer water."
"Buffalo Bob, I don't like to talk about strings.  I don't like to complain, but you know real cowboys have Stetson hats, that's what I should have. They're made in Texas, Buffalo Bob.  Do you have a Stetson, Buffalo Bob?"
"Well, yes I do...."
"Well, see, there you go!  I should have a Stetson, too."
"But Howdy, remember, you asked about this before and Stetson didn't have one your size which is 1-1/2,  remember?  No size 1-1/2."
"Well, even more important, I've got my cowboy outfit, but I can't be a real cowboy without a HORSE.  Can you get me a real horse, Buffalo Bob?  Maybe a miniature horse until I grow bigger."
"A horse?  Horses cost a lot of money, Howdy...."
"And I'd need some spurs.  I need spurs so I can kick the horse to make him go fast."
"Howdy, that would be mean to kick the poor horse!"
"Well, he'd better go fast, if he didn't, it would be 'No more Mr. Nice Guy' then!"
"Do you mean 'No more Mr. Nice Puppet'?  We can't afford a horse, Howdy, this is a low budget show."
"Another thing, I really need to get rid of these freckles.  I've got 48 of them, one for each state!  That's too many.  I never liked them anyway. How can I get rid of them?"
"Well, I suppose some paint remover would do it, but you need them, it's part of your nerdy appeal."
"Paint remover!  No, no, I have tender skin, Buffalo Bob."
"Howdy, I explained, you're a wooden puppet, you've got enamel, not skin."
"Buffalo Bob, I've been reading about the old Wild West shows and Annie Oakley.  She was a sharpshooter.  She could shoot coins.  Throw up a silver dollar and she would shoot it out of the sky!  I could be a sharpshooter on the show!
"Howdy, we can't do that!"
"I've got my sixgun, but I need bullets-  can you get me .11 calibre bullets?  Get .11 longs, they've got more power! And how about this-  I could shoot from horseback like Annie did.  I would ride into the studio on my horse and shoot an apple that Clarabell throws up, the kids would love that and...."
"Howdy, Howdy, you're talking crazy! We can't shoot guns in the studio!"
"Honk, honk."
"What is it, Clarabell?   Oh, I see. We still need to do that Rice Krispies spiel. I hate that mushy cereal- Crackle and Pop- what a joke!"
"Here's the box, Howdy, and don't knock over the box this time!   And then it's Winky Drinky time across the street! Clarabell, do you have to wear your clown suit to Winky's?"
"Wait, Buffalo Bob, I want to go, too."
"But Howdy, it's not possible, besides, you're too young to go to a bar. Bye, now."
"Buffalo Bob....
Buffalo Bob....
Buffalo Bob...."
"Oh, all right, Howdy, C'mon along.  But you can't have a beer, you're too young."

Kiddie-folk all engaged upon the snooze, great imagining took place about sweetened purple tree-fruit.

Mine Old Lady, babushka-clad in addition with myself, too, in particular ensconced by woolen headgear began nightly zee cutting.  (GB: zed cutting)

Beyond the East wall, grand ear-shattering clattering was!  Myself, house-master, moved upwards leaving sleep-mat and wooden pillow for now, want see about the thing!

 Pretty small winter-style sliding vehicle linked via yarn to attached octet of reduced-size horned ponies is there!

“Who the **censored** is commanding such dingbat contraption?  Woodland troll?  Go away, please!”

This winter vehicle dictator is vexed, cursing loud expletives and nomenclatures:
“Duncer!  Plopper!  Dingley! and Kitchen!”

For calling many curses!  Stamping sharp hoofies can be heard, puncturing perhaps holes in dwelling waterproofing. Time to place loading to the family shotgun; a quick solution to this affront from above by the demons!

Uninvited guest ignores “No Smokey, Okey- Dokey?” sign plainly on East wall (big type lettering).  Jerk-Head all during invasion is pipe operating!

All people must notice derelict peddler possess big round belly- Aristotelian logic: not too poor to pop into face large food particles!

Chuckling behavior- good for business,  but the winking?  Too much cuteness!  Recommend Dale Carnegie Course for this one!

Red dwarf opens now grain sack.  Is object to perform robbery upon us, who do not deserve devious robbing?  
Not the robbing, the putting of unknown objects…what is ?  Stuffing objects into personal wool-type footwear of family mine!

“Cease!” speaks myself.  “No **censored** recycle center is maintained enclosed herein.  Public dumping not encouraged!”

Perhaps because of staring from my eyes and subtle waving 12 gauge, Mr. Snow Sprite stopped sock filling activity and enacts quick climbing back up, can you believe?  Up smoke flue having absence of foot-rungs!!  Is mine eyeballs being deceitful to us?  A ghost have was seen just this hour past?

Whistling to pony crew now?  Great relief,  the red shabby tramp,  he gone!
I quick empty socks into fire, Hah.  Junk gone.   

A small voice!  “Happy Christmas to All…..!”  Or was it an owl call in the wind?

Room has quiet this period.   Brain of my own does contemplate.   Was it merely creepy visit equals a vanishing bad dream-experience?  Might be was myself off-kilter, (previous meal eating celebratory wine consumption took place; too many foolish gulps by myself is possible).  

Ahh, returns my body to sleeping mat.  No more crazy nightmares, please!

Mamma stirs.  “What is awful smell, pipe you smoking?”  I speak, “No, is wood stick in fire compartment, Oak smells like that.  Sleep now, please.”

A Visit From a Traveling Salesman
Aah-eeh-ah-eeh-aaaaaah-eeh-ah-eeh-aaaaah!
I had dozed off on the couch when I heard the faint jungle cry.  I stirred....a dream, I thought....but....
Aah-eeh-ah-eeh-aaaaaah-eeh-ah-eeh-aaaaah!
There it was again!
I shuffled, still sleepy, to the door and cautiously opened it.
There stood a stooped and wrinkled barefoot man wearing only a leopard-skin loinclth.
He was awkwardly holding an ACME vacuum cleaner, dragging the cord behind him.
"ME TARZAN!", he said, pointing to himself.
"ME JOEL!", I responded, reflexively.
Could this be the renowned mighty Lord of the Jungle? Of course, the years do go by, and I myself am a little stooped and wrinkled.
I recalled the legend-  the poor fellow was orphaned and raised by kindly grey apes....wait!  As I gazed past his gaunt figure I beheld a scruffy Ford Model T.  Someone was at the wheel...it was a grey ape!
A bit surprised by all this, I never-the-less remembered my manners and invited them both in with welcoming gestures, and they came.
We are not an ostentatious family, but we do have comfortable chairs and I offered same to our guests, but to no avail.
"This is a CHAIR, I said, helpfully pointing.
"CHAIR?", asked Tarzan.  "GREGH?", asked Mr. Ape.
I then I demonstrated with my body the principle of the chair.
"SIT!", I said as I sat.
To no avail.  My guests remained standing (slouching).
"How about a cup of coffee?", I offered.  I fetched some which had been brewed earlier by Marnie.  
I handed a full mug to Tarzan and in a wink I realized my mistake as he turned it all around to examine it and spilled it on his toes!
"Aah-eeh-ah-eeh-aaaaaah-eeh-ah-eeh-aaaaah!", he remarked, louder than before. 
I apologized profusely.  Tarzan massaged his toes and then seemed to remember why he had come.
"Madam, vacuum is good for you!  Here, plug me vacuum!", he said as he held the plug an inch from my nose.  I found a place to plug it in and it WHIRRR-RRR-RRRR-ED as vacuums do.
Tarzan now energetically scurried around the room vacuuming. His grey ape friend (step-brother?) pranced excitedly.  It was a canister vacuum and he held up an attachment before he put it on the hose.
"RUG!", he said and used it on the drapes. The drapes attachment he used on the rug.  Also, the hose was plugged into the wrong end of the canister and it blew clouds of dust into the air.
The helpful Mr. Ape picked up the couch and Tarzan blew out a storm of dust bunnies.
"Cough!" said Tarzan.  "Cough, cough, ....you buy vacuum!", he continued, pointing at me.
How could I refuse the poor old guy?  Past retirement age and no social security in the jungle.  I had some cash in my wallet and it was enough.
Out of the back of the Model T came a box with my vac.  "Made in China" it said on the side.  Mr. Ape gave the crank a hearty spin and the T chugged to life.  The aged Lord of the Jungle climbed into the narrow Ford.  
I had one more thing to say to him.
"You know, Tarzan, it's my understanding that you are the son of the Greystokes, who were members of the British peerage.  You could contact your relatives and surely they would help you out-  you don't have to sell vacuum cleaners!"
He shook his head and responded.
"Naw, me try.   They say no believe fake story!  Raised by apes?  Ha, ha, ha, they say!"

Plucky Smiley, a perky chicken, was doing “Man-In-The-Street” interviews for the Duckburg News Channel.

She approached the slumped figure of a duck with ruffled feathers, no longer white, and wearing a grimy sailor suit.  His webbed duck feet splayed as he sat on the curb .  He was clutching a bottle in a paper bag as he surveyed his back-alley surroundings and scowled.

“Excuse me, Sir, may I have a word with you? “
“Buzz off, chicken!”  spoke the derelict.
“Please,  it will only be a minute…say, you look familiar,  is it from TV or movies?  Wait, I know!…You’re Daffy Duck, aren’t you!” 
                “SQUAAAWK??!!  Don’t mention that name to me!  That no-talent imposter!  He’s not even a duck, for Cripe’s sake, he’s a loon or something… he worked for Looney Tunes, didn’t he?? Well, listen, Girlie, I’m Donald A. Duck!!  And I’m the biggest duck in the business, Lady…now go away!”

“Oh, I’m sorry,  Mr. Duck.  You sound like you have a whole hard-boiled egg in your mouth,  am I interrupting your lunch?”
“Lady,  that’s the way I talk!  You ever hear of persona?  You ever hear of branding??” 

“Mr. Duck,  I think I remember you from the cartoons,  did you do ‘Steamboat Willy‘?  “
“QUAAAACK! You Dumb Cluck! No,  that wasn’t me…it was some effeminate mouse with bagels for shoes,  a has-been they hired cheap!”

“How are things going for you, Mr. Duck,  have you made any movies lately?”

“Well, if you must poke your big beak into my business, I’m out of work…that’s why I’m out on the street begging.   I had a part lined up for 'Planet of the Ducks'  but they got some bargain ape suits when the Tarzan movies faded, so apes in, ducks out.”

“No pension from the studio?”

“Don’t make me laugh!… Actor’s Guild minimum all the way, $1.00 a day and lunch…and that was Purina Duck Chow!  It was sawdust!  “

“Times are tough lately?….”

“Listen, you wanna hear troubles?…My longtime girlfriend of 88 years, Daisy, finally dumped me, just like that, then she married that popinjay Gladstone Duck, a ne’er-do-well who never worked a day in his life!  My three nephews are still living with me even though they’re all retirement age!  They just play video games all day and think up tricks to play on me!” 

“But surely you could get some other work if the studio isn’t hiring…”

“You should see my resume:  59 jobs but only for one day each…  you don’t learn a thing, except to stay out of the way!…mailman, carpenter, fisherman,  lumberjack…(for that one they gave me a rubber axe, said I was excitable)…milkman,  factory assembly,  …Hey , never a doctor or lawyer, either!”  “Uncle Scrooge does hire me sometimes to drive his limousine, for 10 cents a day.” 

“Have you lived in Duckburg all your life?”  

“Yes, funny thing is,  I just woke up one day in 1934 all grown, didn’t seem to have any mother or father and no memory of childhood.”  “Maybe that’s why I can’t fly, nobody taught me.”


“In your movies,  did you have a double or did you do your own stunts? “  

“Honey, I fell off cliffs and out of airplanes, never a double, it was me, and  all they had for first aid were little X-shaped band-aids!” 

Donald took a big swig from the bottle and wiped his beak.  

“From your uniform, I take it you have naval experience, perhaps…”

“Hah!…my sailor suit was issued from the studio, some Salvation Army leftover, sleeves are too short and it’s the same one for 88 years now! I only have one,  so I have to stand in my feathers while it gets washed!  
“I asked for shoes,  Daisy got shoes didn’t she?….But  they said they didn’t stock EEEEEE width.”
“Listen, Lady,  I’m sorry I called you a Dumb Cluck.  Do you suppose you could spare a dollar?”

“OK,  Here.  It‘s sad…. you used to be a big star in pictures…”

“I am big…It’s the pictures that got small!”

“I’ve got to go, but tell me, how do you make your hat jump off your head when you’re surprised?”

“It’s easy,…watch my sailor’s hat and say ‘Surprise!’”

“Surprise!”

But the hat didn’t move.

This Happy Day! the Weekly Column of Joy
by Suzy Sparkle
Oh my Dear Readers I'm excited!  It is Fall and I found these stunning colored leaves! Look at this one- a gorgeous yellow, not just yellow but a golden yellow yellow with maybe some canary, or lemon around the edges. I did not have to go far, they are all around my neighborhood.  Let's look together for some more... Oh, won't you be my neighbor?   Or NEI-EI-EIGH-BOR, as my horse, Cream Puff, would say!  "Won't you be my neighbor?" I think I'll write a little song about that- but later, later.... see this yellow beech leaf?  By the magic of the printing press, courtesy of Mr. Gutenburg, (did he do color?) here it is now!  
***insert drawing of oak leaf*** 
For today's Suzy column we're going to do something special- preserve this leaf using WAX PAPER.  This is really easy to do using an ordinary ironing iron like this one I have OW!  OW!- don't touch that part- you probably have one of these and you may have an ironing board, and I have one, too, but I don't know where it is right now so I'll just put this dish towel on my bureau and here we go.  
Put the leaf between the wax paper and gently iron- see, the leaf gets flat- wait a minute- it's turnng brown!  Bleep!  the bleeping iron is too bleeping hot!- let's lift it up OW!  OW!  OW!- touched the bleeping bleep iron   OH NO! BLEEEP!! the iron melted the varnish and my good dish towel with Elvis on it is stuck to my grandmother's antique bureau she brought over from the old country and lied about its value to the customs inspector!  Oh, no she didn't- that's just a story she used to tell!
Time to sit down and take a deep breath.  Here I have other leaves- here's a bright red one- hah, we're not done yet- got plenty of leaves, the bleeping trees dump them all over our yard!  And my bleeping lazy bleep husband, Norwood, never rakes them! Oh my!- yes, here's a beautiful crimson one- Oh Readers, let's iron this one- an oak or maple or butterscotch this time and... Oh, I see I have to go now.  Stop by next week for "This Happy Day"!  We'll be knitting some baby booties or some bleeping thing!

From the diary of Margaret Mitchell's little-known envious sister, Lulubel:
Dear Diary,
I will either string together this cute bead necklace kit (on sale at Kresge's, 79 cents) or write that novel I've been planning.  Let's take a look at these pretty beads.  Need scissors for this package....but you know,  I've been looking for those scissors and can't find them....I'll just rip this package, how hard can it be.. OH BLEEP! I split it open and all the beads went everywhere!  
Ok, relax now.  OK, the novel is a better idea.  Here goes:
Tex, whose real name was Pembrook Pamby, crouched by the smoldering campfire and used his forefinger to push up his new Stetson which cost $49.95 at the Tombstone General Store, the one on Tumbleweed Street, but it stuck on his sweaty forehead and he pushed too far and his new Stetson flopped into the smouldering ashes of the outlaw's campfire and he tottered on his new high-heeled boots, losing his balance and toppling into the still hot fire before he could explain what he learned from the campfire about the escaping outlaws, losing some trail cred in the onlooking eyes of the Pinkerton men who had hired him.
NAW!  Let's start again. 
Angelina dreamed of being a a famous opera singer!  Yes, yes, yes, she repeated to herself. I WILL appear as a headliner at the famed opera house in Vienna and around the world!  I know I will have to practice every day for hours, but I will, I will! No silly games like my lazy friends.  And I know I'm only a little fish in a big pond, but that won't stop me!  Unfortunately, things were worse than she thought, because Angelina was indeed a little fish, a goldfish swimming in a pretty small goldfish bowl and could not sing except for a little gurgling sound that the other goldfish couldn't hear, even if they had ears. 
NAH!  Maybe time for a refreshing glass of wine about now, unless I finished it this morning...Ah, here it is.
Let's start that novel again, Diary:
Casey glared at the opposing pitcher as he applied some more pine tar to the handle of his trusty bat, Buster.  He pawed at the dirt with his cleats so his feet would not slip.
His body was a tightly wound spring as the lanky pitcher hurled a blazing fastball that caught the low edge of the hitting zone and it went SMACK into the catcher's glove before Casey could swing.  He swore under his breath and dug in, ready this time. "Start your swing when the ball leaves his hand.  Start your swing when the ball leaves his hand." he repeated to himself the cardinal rule of hitting.  Here's the ball... SMACK! into the catcher's glove. Now Casey was getting mad,  he stepped out of the batter's box and adjusted his calfskin batting gloves and pushed his helmet tight to his head and thumped the plate with his bat and stared at the mound with a terrible glower.  The windup...and a 100 mile per hour pitch came right down the middle as Casey stood frozen! "Strike three, yer out!" yelled the umpire. Casey thought, "Maybe the fix is NOT in."
NAW!  Where are those beads?, let's pick up these beautiful beads and look at the instructions and maybe pour a bit more wine, Diary, what do you say?

What's in the mail today? Here's something from Friends of the Ocean.  "Dear Supporter, We are glad to tell you that the Grumpy Carp is no longer endangered, in fact has multiplied in record numbers, so we have discontinued our recent emergency campaign and we are returning the money you contributed, with interest from last July.  Thanks again. 
Also, no whales have beached themselves at all, anywhere, so our entire beach rescue crew is being laid off and offered the option to be retrained as street jugglers or mimes or something.  Cordially, Wilton Smathers,  President"
Interesting.  Here's one from The American Heart Advisory Committee:  "Dear Contributer:   Please do not send any contributions to our nationwide Anti-Twinkie Initiative.  We have discovered that a high-Twinkie diet is beneficial, and now also recommend those fluffy marshmallow cupcakes sold under the brand name 'Sugar Bombs' ."
Wait, am I reading this right?  There is more.  Here's a heavy package from The Franklin Mint.  What's in it?  My Gosh, coins!  "Dear Sir or Madam:  We are pleased to send you 100 solid gold coins stamped with the likeness of the King himself, Elvis!  Our company owner, Snidley Fringleham II, since he has 88 billion dollars, not counting the two countries he owns, has decided to give back so he is sending coins to some peasants like you. Please ignore our previous ads for coins which really were way overpriced, let's face it."
Let's pause here to catch my breath.  
"Dear Billy Bob,  Thank you for your recent purchase of the Rolex watch ($9.99 plus tax) from the home shopping network Home Shopping Network.  Due to certain communications with the U. S. Federal Trade Commission, regarding trademarks, we would like to ask you to please apply the enclosed little sticker with the word "Rotex" directly over the word "Rolex" on the watch you recently purchased.  Be sure to completely cover the word "Rolex".  On a further note, your subscription to "Hollywood Gossip" magazine has been delayed due to last-minute libel considerations. 
Next on the mail pile:  An envelope marked "IMPORTANT".  Naturally, I hasten to rip it open.  "Dear Mr. Bob, We received your contribution to our "Sweaters For Squirrels" campaign, however, we are returning it because further study has revealed that squirrels have plenty of fat and fur to keep warm after all. Further, I am eliminating my own job and closing the doors on our penthouse headquarters.  Sincerely,  Palmer "Biffy" Featherstone.  
What's this? Something else from The Franklin Mint.  "Dear Sir or Madam,  There has been an unfortunate mistake.  Mr.  Fringleham II has consulted with his tax attorneys and it seems that the gold coin giveaway will not result in tax reduction after all!  So please send back the gold coins he so generously sent to you.  Your prompt attention to this matter is appreciated.  Sincerely, Fungus Parmelton, Esq.
I put this letter in the recycling bin, it's good to recycle, you know. 
Let's continue with the mail.  Next is an envelope decorated with pine trees.
"Dear Adopt-A-Tree Patron:
It turns out that TREES are causing global warming and subsequent expected disastrous flooding, too much CO2, and something about ozone, too. (See National Enquirer 12/3/22, p.3).  Naturally, this news has caused some changes in our organizational policy.  We have cut down all 75 million acres of trees in our Adopt-A-Tree worldwide program, including your particular adopted tree which you named "Old Hickory" even though it was a hemlock. Proceeds from tree sales will go to the purchase of gigantic machinery for slash cutting evil trees in the Amazon Rain Forest.  Sincerely, Clendon Butterball, Chairman"
What's this?  A package.  "Your gift from The Postal Worker's Pension Fund" it says on the outside.  It's a DVD.  It's  the movie "The Postman Always Rings Twice". Yeah, I know it, a 1946 film noir.  
RING!  RING! 
I roll over in bed, groggy, and wake up from my dream.  I pull on my bathrobe and answer the door. The mailman hands me the real mail.  On top is a fuel oil bill for $756.67.

Dab Gummit! These two don't work! 
Got the 12 fuzzy wind-up chicks, $1.17 each, but two don't work!  Wouldn't hop and peck! Of course, I fretted and couldn't sleep.  I got up at 2 AM and tried again- carefully wound up Puffy- but she only made a ticking noise and Fluffy ticked and fell over on his side, his feet making a pathetic wiggling. What to do? Maybe just a little repair and good to go, I thought.
I found the official website of The International Windup Chick Institute. To repair, first you have to xray to find out if you have type A or type B windup chick.  Billy Bob's dentist did this for me and I could tell I had the Type B 'cause it had the Phase-locked Loop Control Subsystem. I removed the Tummy Access Panel.  From there, I took out the Sperry Vertical Gyroscope Assembly, but at this point, my dog Ruffus jumped up and knocked the Norden Bombsight Achromatic Escape Mechanism out of my hand and some little gears dropped on the floor. I did not seem to be making much progress and I looked ahead at the instructions and  saw that the windup chick expert advised that "Successful repair requires watchmaker's tools and  the industry standard three computerized devices: an Antigravity Amorphic Balancer,  a Windup Chick Pontryagin Control System Analyzer and a Ratheon Model 7 Centralizer." 
I have a few tools in my garage, but not these, so I wrapped up the two chicks and wrote a diplomatic letter to the You Betcha Good Corporation, located in Beijing, China, explaining that although I was very happy with the ten chicks that hopped and pecked very well, I could not say the same for the two enclosed and respectfully requested they send replacements.  I did not want them to lose face, so I mentioned that the You Betcha Good Corporation was held in high esteem where I myself lived which was in Connecticut, USA.  Of course, I was laying it on a bit thick about You Betcha Good Corporation being in high esteem, as I had never heard of them.  Now I used an on-line translater to produce a Mandarin Chinese version of my letter and sent it off.
Two months later I received a reply and I was able to translate to English:
"Dear Notorious Nerd:
All your best friends at You Betcha Good Corp. wish you tidings of joy!  What is with chicks product?    Unknown to us. Suggest maybe please very please you go to My Glorious Happy Co. to accomplish this merch. We ourselfs can sell big sale Elvis Neckties @56yuan per doz. I personally do not believe you are a capitalist pig.  We can offer Dolly Parton figurine @76yuan per doz.  Now we go, Xi Wii Chi, Bossman"
There seemed to be some translation confusion going on here.  Billy Bob didn't think so, though.
"Listen, this is just a smokescreen!  They're keeping the two chicks and they pretend not to understand plain English," he said.
Perhaps he was right I thought, perhaps this tough Bossman, sitting in his luxurious windup chick factory, with its fast-moving assembly lines copied from Henry Ford, watching hordes of hopping, pecking chicks spewing forth, chortled as he chucked Fluffy and Puffy into the trash and instructed his overworked underlings to deceive those hayseed American yokels with the old "What chicks?" gimmick letter!  
The next day I got a package.  I opened it and there were 12 windup chicks!  A letter explained that there were TWO You Betcha Good companies, one a Corp. and one a Corporation, and my complaint letter went to the wrong one and they finally realised that and they forwarded my letter to the real windup chick folks who then apologised and sent me 12 new chicks!  
To celebrate, I wound up the 12 chicks all at once and set them hopping and pecking on my table.  A happy group of fuzzy chicks, except one pecked but didn't hop and two hopped but didn't peck.

"One Tire's Life"
Let me tell you how it is with a tire.  My name is Charlie Tire and I have rolled many miles over the hills and valleys of this old earth.  Let's start at the Beginning: I was born in the GungHo-Min Factory  in Pang  Province, China.  It was the night shift and the weather was hot and the huge vulcanizing press was hotter as I popped out.  The first words I heard was Chin-Saou saying, "A bad one, Chummy, warped treads, let's dump this one!"  "Naw, said Chummy, "just wrap that loser up quick, before anybody sees!" I have been forever grateful, Chummy!  My birth name was GM-8,60 X4, but I later took the more friendly name Charlie.  I soon joined a multitude of my tire brethern as we were unceremoniously loaded into a shipping container and hence aboard a containership.  The accomodations were somewhat crowded and I complained along with my new pals.  "We're packed in here like sardines!" said Skippy. Well, when you are a very young tire, you don't know much about the world and I don't think he knew what sardines were and neither did I.  There was a strong smell of rubber and Danny speculated that we were all rubber basketballs and we talked about not wanting to be bounced around being dribbled and then dunked into a hoop.  What if some dumb kid overinflates us?  We worried about that. You know they poke a NEEDLE into you to put the air in, that's gotta hurt!" moaned Benny.  
 They slammed our container around during unloading and we bounced around like we were made of rubber which we were, but after another bumpy ride things got quiet. I was unwrapped and breathed in some cool, fresh air.  Well, it wasn't so cool as I was in this little garage in Punktown, AZ, daytime temp of 100 degrees F, but I didn't know about F temp scale, being a young tire. Some other tires were there, just hanging around and they all were older and they had learned a few things from listening to people talk and they passed on some to me. I learned that I wasn't a basketball, but a tire and likely my job in life would be rolling over roads attached to a car or maybe a truck. I made friends with Hank and Mildred and Jesse, but before long Bucky, the garage owner, sold my pals to customers and off they rolled.  Pretty boring for awhile but one day this young squirt of a kid with a cowboy hat came swaggering  in and he needed a tire and asked Bucky for the cheapest one he had and Bucky rolled me over off the rack to be inspected. "Got warped treads there, Gramps!" says the kid.  I didn't like him right away, and thought "Don't sell me to this punk kid, Bucky!" but he did and for a discount, too, wouldn't you know!
Well, Bucky pops me onto the tire machine and blasts me with 90 psi OOWW! to set my rubber rims to the steel rims.  Rolls me outside and I could see right away the kid's got this gawdawful old junker of a jalopy, even though I am just a young tire I could see that. I was put on the left rear on his rear wheel drive crate. SCREEEEEEECH!  That's the sound of us rear tires as he peeled away down the road. It made me kind of dizzy being spun at a few hundred rpm, but I got used to it, and at least there was something to see besides the back corner of Bucky's garage.  Well, this fellow had some name I don't remember, but I called him "Punk", and he was pretty reckless and sometimes I was sure we were headed over the edge into a canyon and sure enough one day his girl friend was riding with him and he went around a corner too fast, showing off, and hit the ditch and the car ended up on its right side!  I was therefore dangling up in the air, still spinning for awhile, same as Sammy, the left front tire.  Girl friend was mad as they climbed out, "My Daddy was right about you, a reckless no-good, I hate you, Fenton!" she said. That was his name, Fenton.  Way to go, girl, I thought, dump him for good. The car was crinkled up a lot beyond what it already was and got sold for junk and the junkman, Prescott, took us tires and we sat around his junkyard and time seemed to stand still.  Sammy, Cliff, Helen and I just hung around.  We got to playing a game of imaginary poker, didn't have cards, we just  thought of the cards being dealt.  Fun, but Sammy won a lot, maybe wasn't entirely an honest tire, you think? One day Prescott has some black paint and paints all us tires so to look new, not scuffed and used and before we knew it we were put in a new tire store in Chicago. A fellow in a gray Fedora came in the next day, in a hurry, needed four tires and we were them. We get put on his 12 cylinder Lincoln Continental and Helen, our pal tire who has been around tells us,"That's Dillinger that owns this car, John Dillinger who knocks over banks all the time! Well, you could suspect he was packing heat the way his suitjacket bulged right out.  He spent a lot of time driving in the middle of the night and parking in alleys near banks, maybe he was casing, you think? Then this day he parks right in front of The First National Bank of Evanston and leaves the engine running.  "I smell trouble," says Helen. Five minutes later out comes Dillinger, his hat flying off his head and we speed off, weaving in and out of traffic.  "Listen," says Sammy, "you all deflate some air!" he says to us tires.  Tires can do that, just lift a gap off the rim and leak air, we sometimes do that just for a joke.  A siren we could hear behind us. We leaked air and it wasn't long before we went flat and the big car was slowed right down and stopped and the hapless robber ran for it, but was slowed by carrying a suitcase full of money and the cops nabbed him.  "Did you buy cheap tires, John?" the cops taunted him. Did us four tires get any credit? No. His car was sold and the snobby new owner replaced us with whitewalls, so once again I had no home until the big circus came to town and needed tires for their clown car.  I was right front and it was a pretty good gig.  See, I'll tell you a little secret how they get so many big clowns in that little car. They got a trap door.  They drive the car in and park right over the trap door.  Then all those clowns come out that were hiding under the trap door!  Good part is we get applause, which is good, even if you are just a tire. Bad part is the circus has a long off season and the clown car just sits in the smelly animal barn for months.  Fact is I had many other owners after that before I finally ended up in The Museum of the Twentieth Century where I am now on display, old and somewhat bald, so you all can know about tires before all cars and trucks began using antigravity floating to get around.

Air Travel Made Easy
Airplanes are big buses made of aluminum foil that go up into the sky really high. What holds the plane up? Wings. There are two types of wings- fixed and flapping. Fixed wings were developed by the Wright brothers and flapping wings were developed by the Wrong brothers. Jazz age flyers favored the flapping wing planes, and got the knickname "flappers". The jouncy ride made serving drinks difficult and these days you seldom see a flapping wing plane. Wings have a special shape and because of the air flow pressure difference or something they hold the plane up, but if you stop in the sky, all bets are off and the invisible force called "gravity" will cause the whole shebang to drop like a rock, but let's not talk about that. 
At the front end is the highly trained pilot who has gotten the job by passing a test with questions like "What is an airplane?". Your highly trained pilot will not stop in the sky, so don't worry.  Unless, of course, a blundering idiot pilot turns the engines off by mistake while reaching for coffee, or the fuel runs out, or the engines explode.  But then of course everyone can use their parachutes to float down slowly... oops...actually there aren't any parachutes, so don't count on that.  Instead, it is recommended that you place your food tray in the upright position and secure it with the little thingy.  For your air travel you may have a choice of seats: aisle, center, or window.  Here are some tips: 
1. Never pick the aisle seat because you will be bumped by people carrying giant suitcases and passing serving carts causing you to spill your drink and the pilot will constantly advise everyone to see the once-in-a-lifetime sight out the window which you can't see at all because center person and window person are sticking their fat heads in the way. 
2. Never pick the center seat because you will be constantly getting up to let the window seat person get by and invariably the aisle person and the window person, who have never met before in their lives will start blabbing to each other about every boring detail of their empty, meaningless lives and exhanging names, addresses, and phone numbers and reaching across in front of you and your book to show off their cheap rings or palm read their fortunes. 
3. Never pick the window seat as the sun will be very bright in your eyes and you will have to climb over two people to get in or out and you will have to go the bathroom as soon as you sit down and aisle person and center person will scowl at you for requesting three or four measly drinks as though you were a lush. 
After boarding to start your exciting air journey your flight attendent will ask you to buckle your seat belt. The seat belt will hold you in place in case of a crash or severe air turbulence. If the plane turns upside down, instead of cracking your head on the ceiling you will be held helplessly upside down attached to your seat. If any of these happen, place your food tray in the upright position and secure it with the little thingy. After all are seated, your flight attendent will explain where the emergency exits are.  You are advised to memorize these locations, as you can't read the signs in the dark or with the cabin filled with smoke as you claw your way past the losers who didn't pay attention.
Your flight attendent will also explain the use of the little cup that will drop down in your face for some reason, maybe breathing, which is important. Be sure to listen.
If you land safely at your destination, which usually happens, you may see fellow passengers saying prayers of thanks and kissing the tarmac. This is apparently a tradition in some cultures.

If Merch by chance has 100 percent licorice beans, refund will be provided for one half the retail price paid by Peasant upon presentation of purchase receipt or reasonable facsimile thereof within three business days of purchase date (four business days for Hawaii Peasants). Claims of  too sweet or not sweet enough or blagh taste will not be grounds for refund, Tough Beans! Tummy ache complaints will be ignored by Tyrant since Merch is only lumps of sugar. Tyrant shall not be liable for acne outbreaks or loss of income due to excessive sick days incurred by professional victim Peasants. Although the Merch is decribed as "beans" it must be understood that Merch components should not be planted in the ground and if planted will not result in magic tall beanstalks growing from them. THE MERCH IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, AND NO WARRANTY, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, IS GIVEN. PEASANT'S USE OF THE MERCH IS AT PEASANT'S SOLE RISK. Tyrant reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Merch (or any part thereof) with or without notice if it be Tyrant's whim. Tyrant  shall not be liable to Peasant or to any third-party for any price doubling or tripling, suspension or discontinuance of the Merch or lack of the best-tasting red beans. 
TRYANT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO COMPLETELY IGNORE THIS AGREEMENT IF TYRANT FEELS LIKE IT. Calories:  130 cal/serving."

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Picasso,
We are pleased to report that we are advancing young Pablo to the first grade at the New School, (Nueva Escuela). He does well in most subject areas.  However, there is one thing;  we had to award Pablo only a provisional passing grade in art. It is not that he fails to do the assignments, indeed he likes to draw and paint. In fact he seems to regard all assignments as requests for painting or drawing.  Perhaps it is a small thing, really, but Pablo's artwork seems more and more to be "off" just a bit, as in drawing a nice cat but with ears kind of extra large and red fangs and some similar oddities.  Mr. Santos suggested Pablo might need eyeglasses for optical correction of his vision. Another example: Pablo drew a horse that looks fine but it has nine legs.  He drew a colorful turkey, nice but for the extra beaks. However, do not worry, Mr. and Mrs. Picasso, these things tend to be just a passing part of growing up.
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Picasso,
You will be pleased to know that Pablo has continued to do well in Spanish, History, and Mathematics. However, our efforts to teach Pablo good artistic technique has not been very successful.  We of course have pointed out any deviations from the norm that often seem to appear in his work, so that he can make corrections, but it is hard going.  We pointed out that he might have a future as an architect, but that his house supported by alligator feet would not be practical. 
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Picasso, 
Well, another year has gone by and that little problem with young Pablo's artwork has not gone away.
Has Pablo suffered any traumatic head injuries in the past? That can lead to erratic behavior.  We don't want Pablo to be held back by failure in just one academic area, so we have brought in a painting tutor especially to help Pablo learn. We must say Pablo is a clever fellow when discussing art and defending his work. He often says things like "Art is the lie that enables us to realize the truth." We are not giving up.  He said today: "To draw, you must close your eyes and sing." I think special remedial classes are needed.
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Picasso,
We are making progress finally on Pablo's irregular artistic tendencies. We have called in Dr. Sigmund Freud, of Vienna,  who has developed a new scientific procedure called psychoanalysis, a clinical method for evaluating and treating pathologies seen as originating from conflicts in the psyche, through dialogue between patient and psychoanalyst, and he has analyzed young Pablo.  Through many talk therapy sessions with Pablo, he is confident he has identified what is going on with the poor boy.  In Pablo's early childhood he was scared by a some entity, he thinks maybe a large chicken or raccoon and this fear has remained dormant in Pablo's subconscious. This causes disruptive patterns in young Pablo's brain and thus crazy drawing. Long story short, Pablo should be treated by gradual introduction of the fearsome entity, that is, a scary chicken, such that Pablo becomes accustomed to this and the unconscious fear subsides, and with it this exasperating nonsense drawing.
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Picasso,
There is good news and bad news with regards your son Pablo.  In collaboration with the above mentioned Dr. Freud, we have obtained a scary, large chicken, named Mable, into the classroom in gradual steps as recommended by Dr. Freud.  Some of the students were afraid of the chicken, but Pablo quickly overcame his initial hesitation to approach Mable, so perhaps the detrimental hidden trauma had lessened as Dr. Freud predicted. That is the good news, but Pablo has not noticeably changed his weird painting style, in fact collaborated with Mable, getting her to step into the oil paints and then to walk about on his painting with her big chicken feet!  This delighted Pablo, who described the technigue as "pintura de pollo". Pablo unfortunately misconstrued this whole thing, thinking we had brought the chicken to be his painting assistant and declared this to be a really new artistic method and was proud of his discovery, but was willing to share the credit with me and Dr. Freud.  The next day he brought to school an eggbeater which he used to make many swirling patterns with the oil paints, and declared he would call this "pintura de batidor de huevos". So you see, there is still work to be done.
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Picasso,
We would really like to advance Pablo, but the strange drawings persist and not only that but some of the other students have picked up Pablo's approach to art! Pablo is charismatic and talks endlessly, saying things like "Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life." An interesting thing happened at our monthly art show, parents wanted to buy Pablo's paintings and he said, of course, and garnered about 200 pesetas!  Actually, his "Ballerina's Dreamland" had a mysterious glowing quality that I liked, too.  He says, "Are there rules in pictorial art? Tell me, so I may break them all."  I tell him, Pablo, Pablo, it is fun to play, but after a time you must go out into the real world and and they will not accept Pablo drawings such as you persist to make!"  He said nothing, but showed me his handful of pesetas.  What to do?
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Picasso,
There is a wonderful discovery in the field of psychology called behaviorism developed by B. F. Skinner!  It is so simple, yet effective. He has taught chickens to dance and do tricks!  He is very busy of course, teaching at Harvard, but I was able to contact him and he assures me that some simple applications of his technique can be applied in Pablo's case. We can thus get him to complete some rational, realistic paintings and that will satisfy our academic requirements and then he can make all the estupido drawings he wants after that.  
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Picasso,
Unfortunately our efforts to train Pablo with the incremental behavior-reward steps has not worked. Professor Skinner was greatly interested in Pablo's unusual case and he came himself to apply his methods.  In one attempt, chocolates were given to Pablo one at a time as a reward for sensible bits of drawing, but Pablo didn't eat any chocolates, instead mashed the various bon bons onto his painting! The fillings had different colors, you see, except no blue or green. Naturally the other children wanted candy also, so we had to provide chocolates to them. They ate theirs, though. My classroom is on the edge of chaos! In another attempt, Dr. Skinner painted along with Pablo, leading by example, and we were encouraged that Pablo enjoyed talking about their work, side by side. They were having a good time, but as this progressed, Dr. Skinner began to introduce abstract objects and surreal features in his own painting, and before he left offered to take three of Pablo's scribbles to put in a New York art show! I must say, I did like Pablo's "Kites Without Strings" and our janitor did , too.  
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Picasso,
Good news.  Our mathematics teacher, Ms. Gargiola, has suggested a three-step solution for this frustrating situation:  Step One: We get Pablo to complete some paint-by-number paintings of boring subjects by paying him one peseta per color.  Step Two: We photograph these realistic works and put the results in Pablo's student file. Step Three: We let Pablo paint over all these paintings with whatever crazy stuff his little heart desires, as long he doesn't show it to us.  We accomplished this and thus we have been able to advance Pablo with good grades in all subjects.  I had an interesting note from Dr. Freud, it seems he has taken up abstract painting and sent photos of his work, which is totally crazy stuff, indeed, one was "Carl Jung Descending a Staircase" a baffling work giving even Pablo a run for his money.

Dear Mr. Poe,
Thank you for submitting your interesting poem "The Raven" to our editorial department. After careful consideration, we regret that it is not quite right for us.  We like to avoid themes of death and despair in our children's magazine.  However, we try to encourage authors and perhaps with a few changes, your work would be more attractive to us.
Here are some suggestions:   Rather than the midnight arrival of the creepy bird who repeats "Nevermore", the narrator could be a farmer in a nice garden who naturally wants to protect his crop from animal intruders.  His visitor- make him a saucy and hungry rabbit given to flippant remarks like "What's Up, Doc?" instead of "Nevermore".  Give him a funny name, like "Bugs Bunny" and add that he likes one type of vegetable, say carrots.   Now the farmer- make him kind of a blustery, befuddled fellow with a nerdy name like "Elmer Fudd".  Also let Elmer have trouble pronouncing his "R"s, saying things like "You wascally wabbit!".  As your poem progresses, Bugs makes various attempts to sneak into Elmer's garden to steal carrots, such as tunneling or disguising himself as a postal delivery person.  Thus your poem could be more like this:

						            The Rabbit

Dear Mr. Poe:
We read with interest the poetic work you submitted, titled "The Raven". While you have featured a BIRD as a central character which could work in our publication, we regret we cannot publish your poem in its present form.  Please allow us to offer some suggestions that would bring your work more in line with our Field & Stream reader's interests:
1. Instead of the timid, whining insomniac in a dark room, put your narrator in a bright field at dawn hunting ravens.
2. The narrator should have a name like Mack Diesel and a buddy Duke and a Golden Retriever named "Old Yeller".
3. Add plenty of action:  flocks of ravens fly fast from hiding places, but the hunters blast dozens of the crafty birds out of the sky.
4. Add details:  they have a few beers and discuss what size bird shot they are using and their favorite shotguns and the horsepower of their truck's hemi engines.
5. Add spice: a rare WHITE raven takes flight unexpectedly, but Duke is lightning fast with his short-barrel Winchester and nails him, dropping his beer in the process.
6. They discuss how Duke will have Bubba, the taxidermist, stuff the white raven, so they can show it at Duffy's Tavern in Dirtville. 
If you decide to make changes along these lines, don't hesitate to send us the update for our consideration.
Regards, the editors.

Dear Mr. Poe:
What a fine poetic work you have created in "The Raven"! All our editors loved it, however, some editing would be needed to make it something we could publish.
We have some suggestions: Instead of being dead and mourned, make Lenore the narrator! Alive and well and loves knitting!  Keeping your bird theme, have Lenore knit a charming stuffed raven complete with wings and head and beak.  
Now, Lenore is really not a common name, ranking #4656th in popularity in 2023, so how about we call her "Flo" or something like that? Get some empathy for our characters. Also, our readers may have trouble finding black yarn, so maybe we make the bird a cheery bluebird instead.  See where we are going with this?  You might start this way:
          						The Bluebird
					Once while I was noontime napping,
					I heard the postman gently rapping,
					I got up; for I was sitting,
					I then received my "Modern Knitting"!
					It displayed for all to see,
					A bluebird project, just for me!
....see?  Now add the details of how to knit the body, wings, etc. and readers will love it!
So some simple changes could make it worth our consideration. If you decide to give it a try, send it along. Don't forget to specify needle size and yarn size and include photos of the different stitch details.
Sincerely, Modern Knitting staff

Tap, tap...tap, tap, tap...
A man in a gray fedora is hunched over a big manual Royal typewriter, typing with two fingers.  It's a filler story for the evening edition. The frowning man in the wrinkled suit is Clark Kent, reporter for The Daily Planet.
"Hey, Chief, I don't believe this ditzy dame who claims she saw Elvis in the 8th Avenue subway whistling 'Heartbreak Hotel' !"
"Just write it, Clark, we need a story!"
Just then Clark hears a distant siren with his super hearing- maybe it's a job for Superman! He rushes to a nearby storeroom and whips off his glasses, tie, suitcoat and shirt, revealing his blue, yellow and red Superman suit- he turns around- Lois Lane is there getting some typing paper!
"Whaaat? Clark it's you- you're Superman!  I see your Superman suit! Nobody would ever think it even though you have the exact same height and build and same face and voice and you are never seen together!"
"Don't say anything, Lois!" 
They rush out of the room.
"Hey, Perry- look at this- Clark Kent is really Superman!"
"Shush, will you, Lois!"
Then Jimmy Olsen appears.
"What did you say? Clark Kent is Superman's secret identity??"
Superman says, "Don't tell anybody!" as he flies out the window.
Superman flies over to 7th Avenue and leaps over some tall buildings to arrive at the site of the wailing sirens.  It turns out it is not really a job for Superman; it was an old lady jaywalking and three squad cars handled it.
A gloomy Superman sat on a nearby park bench and pondered, thinking to himself: "I'll need a new secret identity, but I don't have any occupational skills except newspaper work and actually, Lois has been covering for me for years, rewriting all my stories."
There was a discarded newspaper on the bench.  Superman glanced at it and with his x-ray vision looked through all the layers of the pages and spotted an ad for APTITUDE TESTING. He noted the address and stored it in his photographic memory and soon was on his way there, leaping over some medium high buildings on the way.  Alas, he completed the test, and the results showed he wasn't qualified for anything but hobo or politician. 
This quandary he explained to Lois by phone.
"Listen, Superman, I have an idea, meet me at The Daily Planet and we will disguise you as my sister, LILY LANE!  Perry will hire you because you are my sister, see? I'll get you a wig and a dress and they'll never know it's you!"
"Lois, that will never work!"
Later, at The Daily Planet storeroom, Superman struggles to put on a red dress with puffy sleeves.
"They had lots of dresses at The Salvation Army Store, if this doesn't fit we'll go back...wait, it's not so bad...I'll zip it up in back for you. Here, put on these high heels, my, you've got big feet haven't you!"
Lois produced a blonde wig and it covered his dark hair except for a curl on his forehead.  
"No, no, no, you've used too much lipstick, Superman, you've got clown lips! You've got to use just a little and smoosh your lips together to make it even."
Just then a police siren sounded.
"Oh, oh,  gotta go, job for Superman, Lois...help me get out of this dress- I can't unzip it in back! How do you women zip up the back zipper, anyway??  Take this wig...quick, unzip me from this red dress, Lois! Get me out of this dress!..."
Then Superman woke up from his dream.
"...Get me out, Lois...Whaat? I was dreaming!  Oh my Gosh! wait.. what's this red dress?  - oh it's my red cape!  I forgot to take off my cape when I went to bed.  What is this blasted cape good for, anyway!? Ooh, my aching head!  That's the last time I stop at Duffy's Tavern after work!"

"Hello, Madam. I assume you are the lady of the house. May I speak with you briefly with good news?" 
"Perhaps. And what would be your name and title, Good Sir?"
"Ah. my name is Corcoran Doveshire, but please call me Corky."
"Pleased to meet you, I'm sure. My name is Her Majesty Victoria, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland Queen, Defender of the Faith, Empress of India."  
"You're Queen Victoria? Gosh, I should have known, from the jeweled crown!"
"Oh, this old thing?  Just one of my everyday crowns, you know."
"Your Majesty, you've got a cracking splendid place here, I must say!"
"Balmoral? Yes, we find it quite adequate. Drafty, sometimes, but one must persevere, mustn't one?"
"Ah. When you mention drafty, I know you will be interested in what I have here!  It's a model of a fabulous system for getting heat for free!  You see, our company, P.T. Barnum, Inc. for a small fee, will install on your roof a system of pipes and parabolic reflectors that allow the sun's rays to heat water for your house!  So you don't need to use a sooty coal-burning boiler as you most likely do at the present time! They're called solar panels . Made of the special metal aluminium, doesn't rust!"  
"Well, I would like to be rid of that coal bill that we get every month!  Please come in and you can show us the model. You can meet Prince Albert, my husband.  Berty, stop reading that racing Form and look at this new invention!"
"Yes, Dear."
"Corky, please excuse this messy room, we had a small party last night.  I'll get Jeeves to clear away all these empty whiskey bottles. We had a good time. Lady Astor got drunk as a skunk!  Lord Wimbley fell down trying to dance The Hokey-Pokey! Broke the trunk off our elephant vase, gift from the Maharajah. The one with the big turban with the red jewel in the front, looked like glass to me I must say, you think, Berty? Say, may we offer you a drink, Corky?  We have Bourbon, Vodka, all those things. Berty and I never drink before noon, but it's close enough."
"Why, I don't mind if I do, it's a warm day to be lugging this equipment door-to-door, Your Majesty."
"Oh, please call me Vicky, all my friends do. I got a bit tipsy, myself, Corky.  I didn't notice my cigar rolling of the table!  Burned that hole in our Persian rug.  That was a gift from what's- his-name, the Shah. That Shah! Just looking for foreign aid ships and things! It was one of these Coronas.  I own all the tobacco farms in Jamaica and some other islands, too.  The Earl of Chesterfield runs them and sends us boxes of Coronas.  The Duke of Marlboro told a about a prank:  you ring up on the telephone...."
"Telephone, Madam?"
"Yes, it's a new kind of speaking tube. If you shout into it they can hear you all the way to Piccadilly Circus! So you ring up a chemist's shop and ask 'Do you have Prince Albert in a can?'  When they say 'Yes', you say 'Why don't you let him out'?"
"Hah, ha,ha! Funny!  Now, Madam, we can provide a complete system for you at only 21,000 pounds, and there is a generous tax deduction."
"Ah, but you see, my good fellow, I don't pay taxes, I collect taxes. Yes, we had the Victrola going, some songs from the Colonies.  The Duke of Hampton tried to sing that one about 'I come from Alabama, my banjo on my knee', but got the words all wrong!  Lady Westchester just got back, sailed on the Queen Mary from New York, tried to teach us The Charleston.  Al, why don't I have a ship named after me, anyway?  What am I, chopped liver? Can you arrange that?  Just drop a hint to the Cunard Line."
"Madam, you can see on my model- the sun has heated the water- it's boiling!"
"Ah, yes, listen, Corky, sign us up for the solar panels, then we'll save on that nasty coal. Write him a check, will you Berty?  And also I ran up a bit of a bill the other day at Dooley's Tavern, write a check for that, too.  But not all money out the door:  I sat in for a few hands of poker, won thirty quid.  Easy, wait till they've had a few drinks, and they make dumb bets!  
Have another drink, Corky!  It's 1898 and time we loosened up on all these Victorian Era restrictions!"
